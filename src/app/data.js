      "Singapore's agritech firm Archisen eyes expansion to cities in APAC & Middle East while expanding capacity at home market [Q&A]",
    text: "Editor’s note: BEYOND Expo 2023, which will be held in Macao from May 10 to 12, will focus on three key areas: BEYOND Sustainability, BEYOND Healthcare, and BEYOND ConsumerTech.\n\nSingapore-based agritech firm Archisen aims to produce up to 300 tons of Asian greens per annum with its automated indoor farm in the city-state while exploring opportunities to build smart farms abroad, its Co-Founder said.\n\n“We are in the process of building a fully automated indoor farm in Singapore that is able to produce up to 300 tons of Asian greens per annum and it will be completed this year. This will triple our production output while allowing us to offer locally-grown Asian greens, which are our local staples to Singaporeans,” Archisen Co-Founder Sven Yeo told TechNode Global in an interview.\n\n“We are expanding our current farm to 10,000 sq ft. We are also in talks with various partners to look into building more farms abroad,” he said.\n\nBesides its home-base Singapore, Archisen, which currently produced lettuces, rainbow chard, sorrel, mustard and ice plant, is looking to expand to cities in Asia Pacific and the Middle East.\n\n“We also have another major project in partnership with a multinational corporation that will be launched this year, which will be very exciting as it is an opportunity for us to showcase our technology in terms of crop science and robotics as it will be open to the general public,” he added.\n\nArchisen designs, builds, and operates solutions to grow ultra-fresh, ultra-local produce in cities. Founded by Yeo and Vincent Wei, Archisen said it operates one of the highest-yielding indoor farms in Singapore. Using Controlled-Environment Agriculture (CEA), the company said it is able to control every aspect of the climate from temperature, humidity, light intensity to composition of air. Thus, it can configure the most conducive environments to bring out the natural, rich flavors of its plants and to retain their nutritional values. Its products are 100 percent local with no pesticides, preservatives or genetic modification, making them fresher, safer, and better than imported alternatives.\n\nThe company said it is the first and only company in Singapore that provides a comprehensive farm management solution for its partners through its turn-key urban farm solution, Cropdom. Cropdom is powered by its proprietary operating system, Croptron, leveraging sensors, Internet-of-things technology and data analytics to track, analyze, and improve farm management processes.\n\nBy monitoring important farm parameters in real-time, the company can collect data to build a system of dynamic automation, thus increasing efficiency. In just a short span of six years, Archisen’s 7,000 sq ft farm has grown to account for the production of about 1 percent of leafy vegetables grown locally by producing up to 100 tonnes of vegetables a year.\n\nWith the use of technology, the company said it achieves up to 100 times the yield of traditional farms from their indoor farms, as well as consuming 95 percent less water and 85 percent less fertilizers.\n\nAs a smart city, Singapore is also leveraging technology to increase locally produced food, as reflected in the 2030 Green Plan’s emphasis on sustainable development through the fusion of agriculture and technology.\n\nArchisen, which claimed itself a pioneer in vertical farming, aims to meet 30 percent of this goal, demonstrating Singapore’s commitment to ensuring a sustainable and self-sufficient food supply for the future.\n\nYeo said Archisen’s investors range from angels, family offices, venture funds to listed companies.\n\nIn the interview, he also shared its strategy and plans which include launching its own craft beer and ice cream, among others.\n\nBelow are the edited excerpts:\n\nWhat are your plans for 2023? What’s your goal/target for the year?\n\nWe are in the process of building a fully automated indoor farm in Singapore that is able to produce up to 300 tonnes of Asian greens per annum and it will be completed this year. This will triple our production output while allowing us to offer locally-grown Asian greens, which are our local staples to Singaporeans. We also have another major project in partnership with an multinational corporations that will be launched this year, which will be very exciting as it is an opportunity for us to showcase our technology in terms of crop science and robotics as it will be open to the general public.\n\nYour company’s current 7,000 sqft farm has grown to account for the production of about 1 percent of leafy vegetables grown locally by producing up to 100 tonnes of vegetables a year.\n\n– How much you’d wish your company will produce?\n\nThis year our total capacity will quadruple and we hope to be able to hit up to 10 percent in the next few years.\n\n– Any mid-term or long term goal in other aspects?\n\nWe want to build the team even further by adding more expertise in various domains to accelerate our development, to provide fruits or even medicinal herbs and products in the long term.\n\n– Any plan to expand the size or number of farms you own?\n\nYes, we are expanding our current farm to 10,000 sq ft and as mentioned earlier, we are already in the process of building another farm in Singapore. We are also in talks with various partners to look into building more farms abroad.\n\nBesides Singapore, are you planning to expand to other cities? Any timeline?\n\nYes, we are looking at cities in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, anytime from next year onwards.\n\nAmong the products you have, which one is producing the most revenue?\n\nOur salad products are the volume products that are driving our revenue growth.\n\nMoving forward, is there any particular product the company will promote more or prioritize?\n\nYes, we pride ourselves in our Ice Plant which is grown in Himalayan pink salt, unlike other competitor products that tend to be bland, we are able to reproduce the natural savory flavor.\n\nAlso, our Mustard is also another popular product that has an intense wasabi-like kick, people love to have it with meat like K-BBQ or sashimi. There are more of such products in our pipeline but the overall goal is for us to surprise and delight our customers by introducing more of such innovative products. We are also preparing to launch our very own craft beer and ice cream products through our partners.\n\nWhat’s your strategy and targeted market for Cropdom, Just Harvest and JustProduce?\n\nThe strategy for Cropdom involves leveraging on our state-of-the-art technology to bring down the cost of production of high-tech farming to be as competitive as we can, enabling not merely a profitable farming business but an investible one.\n\nJust Harvest is all about bringing the crops as close to the end user as possible so that the vegetables can be freshly harvested when needed, rather than preharvested and packed in advance.\n\nJust Produce is all about offering a premium selection of fresh, flavourful produce, hand-picked and carefully selected to ensure the highest quality.\n\nHow soon would you need to raise funds? how much? In which funding stage?\n\nWe are in the process of preparing for our next [funding] round, the details will be disclosed in due time.\n\nWhat are the competitive advantages of your company’s vegetables against the others?\n\nWe are price-competitive, while offering high-quality products with great flavors and nutritional profile, combined with good shelf life.\n\nWhat lies behind your personal belief and conviction in producing quality local produce?\n\nIt’s a well-known fact that Singaporeans don’t consume enough vegetables and part of the issue has to do with the limited choices available, plus they are often also not value for money.\n\nAs someone that is constantly fascinated by what we can achieve with technology, I genuinely feel we can do a lot better. This belief has given rise to the birth of our Just Produce brand and our desire to provide quality produce that is accessible to all, regardless of age, gender and income.\n\nHow does Archisen leverage technology to produce vegetables of the highest quality?\n\nOur technology does not merely involve the use of hydroponics, but is categorized as Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA). The simple explanation is the ability to control everything from the quality of air, amount of light and nutrients to be delivered to the plants, so that their yield and taste can be optimized instead of leaving it to Mother Nature that we know can be fickle at times due to climate change.\n\nSimilar to cooking, our method of growing crops involves developing crop recipes, which spells out the key parameters of growing each crop and their ranges, so that it is consistently reproducible no matter where we are in the world.\n\nWhat’s your vision for Archisen as Singapore charts towards its 2030 Green Plan?\n\nWe have grown quite a lot as a company in recent years but the journey is still far from over. We are expanding our crop portfolio and our farming footprint to provide great quantity and variety to our customers, in our efforts to build food resiliency in Singapore and beyond.",

      "Lighthouse expands in APAC, brings its insights to hoteliers in the region",
    text: "Lighthouse expands in APAC, brings its insights to hoteliers in the region\n\nThe newly-rebranded Lighthouse (formerly OTA Insight) is keen to shine more light on data insights for hoteliers in Asia Pacific. Chief Revenue Officer, David Collier, during a recent visit to Singapore, shared that with the business experiencing significant global growth, Lighthouse is keen to expand its footprint in Asia Pacific, committing more “investment and thought” into the region.\n\n“We have observed steady growth in the region. It is a complex market due to its diversity, and we need to be agile to cater to each market’s unique needs,” said Collier, who has been with Lighthouse for nearly six years following a 13-year tenure at Oracle.\n\n“We are bullish on the region. We currently have offices in Sydney and Singapore, and will be opening in Kuala Lumpur. It won’t be just sales roles, but servicing as well,” he said. Headquartered in Ghent, Belgium, where it was founded in 2012, Collier said the US remains its biggest market with Europe, Middle East and Africa growing fast as well.\n\nLighthouse’s workforce of over 600 employees is strategically distributed, with engineers and HR functions in Belgium, commercial roles in Spain and Denver, as well as Sao Paulo, and a growing presence in Asia Pacific.\n\nChristine Tan, who joined Lighthouse last November as VP of Sales, APAC, remarked, “The feedback from hoteliers about our products has been phenomenal. They tell me that every morning, the insights we provide help them make faster, more informed decisions.”\n\nThe rebrand to Lighthouse, announced last November, consolidates multiple products and acquired companies into a single, unified commercial platform. At the time, it said the shift marked “a significant milestone in the company’s continued evolution as a unified platform that fundamentally reimagines commercial strategy for the travel and hospitality industry.”\n\nLighthouse currently serves hoteliers across 185 countries. The company’s platform is built on data sets covering over 725,000 hotels and 19 million short-term rental properties globally, and is used by revenue and hospitality professionals, destination marketing organizations, asset managers, and short-term rental professionals.\n\nThe enhanced Lighthouse platform introduces new business intelligence capabilities, new short-term rental insights, and a new look and feel to enhance the user experience for commercial decision makers. Data from strategic acquisitions, including StarDekk, Transparent and Kriya RevGen, is now integrated into the Lighthouse platform.\n\nCollier highlighted the ongoing transition in revenue management. “We are seeing more diversified job titles for example, a higher percentage of marketing and sales people, not just revenue managers. We are seeing silos breaking down, roles being consolidated into chief commercial officers, and not just a series of competencies.”\n\n“There is a shift towards a more data-driven mindset and the adoption of new technologies. This is also being driven by the rise of AI. The human-machine evolution is happening, data evolution as well. Hoteliers can take advantage of all the data they are producing to make decisions more quickly. This saves time and makes them more efficient.”\n\nCollier acknowledged the emerging state of AI. “While no one has fully mastered AI yet, we have numerous use cases demonstrating how to create user-friendly insights and deliver Smart Summaries with our BI product each morning that hoteliers can act on.”\n\nCore Lighthouse products and capabilities include:",

    title: "Mastercard agritech platform expands across APAC",
    text: "Mastercard has announced new collaborations with Bayer CropScience and Rabo Partnerships to expand its agriculture technology program, Farm Pass, across the Asia Pacific region after a successful launch in India.\n\nThe digital platform is set to add to the two million smallholder farmers in remote communities that are already connected, with another 13 million to have access to the solution overcoming the digital illiteracy in rural areas and economic hardships faced by residents.\n\nFarm Pass aims to create digital identities for farmers and establish an online record of their income, harvest data and transaction history as well as build a credit profile. Program partners can also onboard farmers at scale and offer in-person assistance to connect them to the platform without the need for a smartphone, internet access or a certain level of digital literacy.\n\nFarmers are then connected to a network of agricultural buyers, inputs dealers and other parties to trade fairly and sustainably.\n\n“While technology has brought profound benefits to much of the world, digitally excluded people in remote communities, like most farmers, face unique challenges in breaking the cycle of poverty,” Ari Sarker, President, Asia Pacific at Mastercard, said.\n\n“Too often, smallholder farmers’ profits are at the mercy of forces outside their control, making them price takers rather than price makers.\n\n“The beauty of Farm Pass is that it works by addressing farmers’ most pressing needs: to get digital, get paid and get capital, giving them greater leverage in the agricultural value chain.\n\n“Importantly, Farm Pass isn’t an aid program or philanthropy—rather, it enables farmers to be properly compensated for their work by cutting out inefficiencies and creating a commercially sustainable system for all involved.”\n\nThe program also serves to ease difficulties within the agricultural value chain that often result in inefficiencies, waste and fraud, promoting financial inclusion, growth, convenience, transparency and operational productivity.",

      "Wunderman Thompson’s Peer-To-Peer Mentoring App for Women Expands across APAC",
    text: "Wunderman Thompson’s peer-to-peer mentoring app for women expands across APAC after a successful launch in the UK last International Women’s Day.\n\n\n\nCalled Magpie, the app’s purpose is to empower and connect women across the business using a matchmaking style app based on each individual mentor’s expertise and knowledge. Complimenting longer-term mentoring schemes available in the industry, Magpie connects women for peer mentorship on specific/individual needs, featuring 15 themes ranging from maternity and motherhood, leadership, building your personal brand and managing stress.\n\nOriginally launched in the UK on International Women’s Day in 2022, the app was created by RISE, Wunderman Thompson UK’s women’s network, and was born from a desire to create a self-serve platform to form connections and support Wunderman Thompson’s women who account for 50% of the agency.\n\nIn the UK, Magpie engaged 50% of the agency’s women in the first week alone, with 20% continuing to use the app each week to connect with a mentor. Those who have been mentored on the app are already returning the favour, with growing interest in becoming a mentor and a 15% increase in mentor sign ups since launch. The app was awarded the accolade of ‘Best Talent Development Initiative’ in The Drum’s Awards for Agency Business 2022. Magpie has since been expanded to all Wunderman Thompson UK’s talent.\n\nAfter a successful pilot scheme across the agency’s APAC offices, Magpie will launch to the region’s talent on 8th March, supporting their women’s network Ladybirds, which aims to strengthen representation and gender parity across the region through networking, mentoring, events and knowledge sharing.\n\nLindsay Shirley, chief people officer for Wunderman Thompson APAC, said: “As senior leaders, we have an obligation to mentor and support women to build their careers and thrive at Wunderman Thompson. Many women have wanted a mentor but not known where to find one, Magpie has helped us bridge that gap and we’re thankful to RISE UK for it.”\n\nSupria Dutta, Head of Talent for Wunderman Thompson APAC and Ladybirds member said: “We are excited to bring Magpie to our region on International Women’s Day. This unique peer mentorship app has the potential to build bridges between women on all levels and potentially open doors for active sponsorship.”\n\nEvie Nagy, senior account manager and co-lead of RISE at Wunderman Thompson UK, said: “Having seen the success of Magpie in the UK, it only seems fitting that Magpie is spreading its wings once again this IWD. It's been great to connect with our teams in APAC, and learn about their specific mentoring needs, and how Magpie can help. I'm immensely proud of what we've achieved with Magpie and how its aided in women's career and personal development. As we said last year, it's only the start as we have exciting plans for the year to come.”\n\nMagpie’s expansion across APAC is the first step in a wider plan to offer access to the app across Wunderman Thompson’s 20,000-strong global network.\n\nThe Magpie branding was devised by senior creatives Charli Plant and Laura Saraiva. Explaining the idea behind the name the team said: “The Magpie platform lets our talent steal pieces of shiny advice from lots of different people, with different experiences across the agency. And for the superstitious amongst us, it just so happens that two magpies together bring good luck and joy!”",

      "Netflix Has Big LatAm Expansion Plans: Produce 50 Shows In Mexico And Open Mexico City Office",
    text: "Fernando Vidaurri/Netflix\n\nFlying high from the positive response to Mexican series and the universal acclaim of Alfonso Cuarón's Oscar contender Roma, living on its platform, Netflix is doubling down on its investment in Mexico and its creative talent. As part of a major expansion in the country, the global entertainment streaming service says it has more than 50 projects created by Mexican talent in different stages of production that include original content and co-productions that it will showcase in 2019 and 2020.\n\n“The richness of talent in front of and behind the camera in Mexico was key in our decision to begin our local production strategy with Club de Cuervos four years ago,\" states Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer. \"Since then, we have continued to expand our local investment and continue providing a platform for Mexican talent to be recognized around the world.”\n\nSome of the Mexican-produced worldwide popular shows currently on the platform include Club de Cuervos, La Casa de las Flores (The House of Flowers), Luis Miguel, la serie and Ingobernable. The company is betting the new Mexican-created shows and films will attract worldwide audiences to new stories and talent.\n\nNetflix announced it will also open Mexico City office later this year.\n\nThe streaming giant confirmed it will add four local films, currently in different stages of development, to its slate over the next two years. They include:\n\nComo caído del cielo - a musical comedy inspired by the songs of Mexican legend Pedro Infante. It stars Omar Chaparro, who hosts Mexico's Nailed it! series on Netflix (also known for roles on Overboard and No Manches Frida), and Ana Claudia Talancón (Perfectos Desconocidos, El Recluso), and is written and directed by Pepe Bojórquez (Más sabe el diablo por viejo).\n\nFondeados - with Marcos Bucay (Club de Cuervos, Yo, Potro) in his feature film directorial and writer debut.\n\nSe busca papá - a family film produced by Corazón Films\n\nAhí te encargo - a modern take on a romantic comedy, written by Tiaré Scanda and Leonardo Zimbrón, and produced by Traziende Films.\n\nThere are also several non-fiction projects in development. Among them: Rio Grande, Rio Bravo, a project that includes five documentary shorts executive produced by Gael García Bernal with producers Elena Fortes and Daniela Alatorre of No Ficción. The documentaries will feature directors like Trisha Ziff, Juan Carlos Rulfo and Everardo González, who'll tackle stories taking place in the U.S.-Mexico border. Other documentaries covering historical events, crime, sports and gastronomy will premiere before the end of the year.\n\nNew projects that will also be added to the slate of Mexican original series include:\n\nLos corruptores - based on the novel of the same name by Jorge Zepeda Patterson.\n\nSofía H. - a young adult series produced by Lemon Films.\n\nBandidos - produced by Leonardo Zimbrón and created by Alejandro Brugués and Esteban Orozco.\n\nEl Club - already in production, it stars Alejandro Speitzer, Minnie West, Jorge Caballero, Axel Arenas and Arcelia Ramírez.

    text: "Nayax Ltd, a global commerce enablement, payments, and loyalty platform, has officially completed its acquisition of VMtecnologia, the Brazil-based technology provider for the automated self-service industry.\n\nThis strategic acquisition, first announced in March, signals Nayax’s expansion into the Latin American market; leveraging VMtecnologia’s long-established position in the region. As of February 2024, VMtecnologia served over 2,400 retailers across all 27 states in Brazil and over 466 cities.\n\nEstablished in 2011, VMtecnologia delivers ‘plug-and-play’ solutions for self-service points of sale, delivering its end-to-end solution for small and medium-sized retailers.\n\nFollowing this expansion, Nayax will now serve over 18,300 additional unattended points of sale, including vending machines, micro markets, autonomous laundromats, and the electronic entertainment sector. The deal could cost Nayax approximately $27million (R$137.5million BR) in total.\n\nYair Nechmad, CEO and chairman of the board at Nayax, commented: “Leveraging our nearly two decades of expertise in the payments industry, we are committed to enhancing the Brazilian market with innovative solutions and are excited about further deepening our presence in this key region over the coming years. Under VMtecnologia CEO Eduardo Muniz‘s seasoned leadership, we are poised to make substantial advancements in the automated self-service payments space in Latin America.”\n\nEstablished in 2005, Nayax started as a cashless payment, IoT service and management solution provider for unattended retail, but quickly expanded to the likes of China, the UK, Japan and Germany in the decade that followed, and now serves merchants across the globe.\n\nEduardo Muniz, CEO of VMtecnologia, also said: “Joining forces with Nayax represents a transformative step for our growth. With today’s strategic partnership, we transition into a new era where we are firmly backed by the global leader in automated self-service payments.\n\n“Nayax’s cutting-edge technology and expertise in payments will propel us into the next phase of our expansion. We are eager to introduce our customers to a broader range of products, diversified payment options, and enhanced consumer loyalty programmes.”",

      "BY-HEALTH’s APAC expansion: China brand sees beauty-from-within and female health markets as first steps",
    text: "The Shenzhen Stock Exchange listed company currently has both online and offline retail presence in Australia and New Zealand since 2019. Last year, it also expanded into Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to Jesse Gu, head of sales and marketing – BY-HEALTH International at BY-HEALTH Co. Ltd, the company’s women’s health products such as Cartidyss Collagen Gummies and Flashnutri Iron Sachet have been its bestsellers in these markets. The company's flagship brand is known as BYHEALTH.\n\nCartidyss Collagen Gummies contains 500mg of French-patented marine collagen, specifically made of concentrated fish cartilage extract, as well as Japanese rose extract and apple polyphenol.\n\nFlashnutri Iron Sachet, on the other hand, contains 17.6mg of iron powder per sachet which would melt in the mouth without having to consume it with water.\n\nBYHEALTH's Flashnutri Iron Sachet\n\n“Inner beauty or edible beauty is a global trend, ​with IMS data showing sales of collagen and iron have been rising in Australia’s pharmacy retail, especially in 2020,​” ​said Gu who is based in Australia.\n\nIn markets outside of China, the company currently has a range of 10 product SKUs, including collagen drink and sleep aid supplements. However, some are only sold via cross-border e-commerce in China due to regulatory restrictions in Australia.\n\nIn the brick-and-mortar space, the company sells four product SKUs in ANZ, including its bestselling collagen and iron supplements, as well as milk thistle tablets for supporting healthy liver function and grape seed hard capsules for supporting general health.\n\nIn Hong Kong, it enjoys an offline presence in Mannings, where it sells both collagen and iron supplements.\n\n“Our market strategies vary from country to country, as we have to understand the demographics first and work through segmentation. The idea is to get consumers to be familiar with and know BYHEALTH first, to be friends with us first. We spread the idea of 'be friends with BYHEALTH' to help consumers relate to the brand. ​\n\n“For example, in China, most consumers we target are from the post-90s generation. Health concerns for this demographic include obesity, stress, liver problems, sleep issues etc. We then develop and tailor the marketing strategies to target these groups of consumers. ​\n\n“​In Australia, ageing is an issue and related concerns include rheumatoid arthritis, high blood pressure, and liver protection, so we have developed specific products for these demographics.​\n\n“In Hong Kong, women have a strong purchasing powder, with our edible beauty supplements targeted at the post-90s demographic a big market as well.\"​\n\nBYHEALTH's milk thistle tablets\n\nAccording to a report by Euromonitor in February, while COVID-19 has led to strong demand for supplements in Hong Kong, there is also a growing number of consumers who are more receptive towards the concept of beauty-from-within.\n\nThis in turn increased sales for supplements that claim to improve skin health, with vitamin C as the more popular product.\n\nAsked how the Chinese brand can compete against well-known Australia and American brands in the international markets, Gu said the key would be to focus on the consumers and understand their needs.\n\nIn this case, the company will continue to develop its edible beauty product range for its APAC expansion.\n\nGu added that the company has been planning to expand to South East Asia but declined to reveal further details.\n\nThe company is still in its nascent stage of international market expansion, and is largely dependent on the domestic market.\n\nIn FY2020, the company recorded a revenue of RMB$6.09bn (US$936m),​ up 15.83 per cent year-on-year, largely contributed by its offline retail activities in China.\n\nBY-HEALTH buses ​\n\nThe company is also planning to introduce BY-HEALTH buses which will provide free health screening services and supplement recommendation across Australia.\n\nThis will be a replication of the firm’s strategy in China, where six BY-HEALTH buses have been touring around the country and providing free testing for chronic diseases, cardiovascular, skin, and bone health problems etc, which is followed up with recommendation to the firm’s products.\n\nGu said that the method has been useful in generating sales and strengthening the brand's presence across China.",

    text: "Zoho Corporation, a leading software company originating from India, recently underscored its commitment to the Bangladesh market by hosting its inaugural 'Zoholics' annual user conference in Dhaka. The event, held earlier this month, was strategically positioned to introduce and deepen the understanding of digital transformation possibilities to local businesses in Bangladesh through Zoho's suite of software solutions.\n\nThe Dhaka conference stands out as a testament to Zoho's ongoing effort to foster closer ties with emerging markets, particularly in the APAC region. Attendees at the event had the privilege of gaining firsthand insights into Zoho's latest product enhancements, showcasing the company's unwavering emphasis on technological innovation.\n\nZoho has also announced a significant achievement: it now supports over 100 million users across its diverse range of more than 55 business applications. This accomplishment distinguishes Zoho as the first self-funded Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company to hit such a mark, especially following its revelation of a billion-dollar annual revenue just last year.\n\nIndustry experts attribute Zoho's consistent growth trajectory to its unyielding emphasis on technological innovation. With the burgeoning prominence of generative AI in today's digital realm, Zoho has adeptly incorporated key updates across its array of products. Notably, while Zoho's influence is palpable on a global scale, it has seen particular growth in the Asia-Pacific area, with Bangladesh emerging as a focal point.\n\nDuring 2022, Zoho reported an impressive 37% business growth. Among its product offerings, some that stood out include Zoho Workplace, a suite prioritising collaboration; Zoho CRM, a tool centred on optimising customer engagement; and Zoho Desk, designed to enhance client service through meticulous support and ticket management.\n\nFurthermore, Zoho's recent technological strides have garnered significant attention within the industry. These include its collaboration with OpenAI to enhance its Zia AI functionalities, the introduction of the Trident Dashboard for Zoho Workplace to augment operational efficiencies, the rollout of Zoho Creator 6.0 which offers notable low-code, no-code capabilities, and the launch of Team Pipelines for Zoho Bigin, which seems set to revolutionise business operations.\n\nHeadquartered in Austin, Texas, but with a strong presence in Chennai, India and a strategic hub in Singapore for the APAC market, Zoho Corporation is renowned for its vast catalogue of over 55 applications. One of the company's distinct features is its commitment to user privacy, notably its decision to forgo an ad-revenue model, even for its complimentary products. As Zoho's ascent in the global tech arena continues, it remains a focal point of interest for industry observers keen to discern its potential future impacts.",

    text: "HONG KONG – 17 September 2019: AirTrunk, a specialist in hyperscale data centres, today confirmed its latest Asia-Pacific data centre development, announcing a new 20+ megawatt (MW) facility in Hong Kong that is set to open in Q4, 2020. The data centre will be located near Tsuen Wan, close to key data centres and Hong Kong’s connectivity hub, enabling direct and low latency access to Greater China and neighbouring Northeast Asian countries.\n\nAirTrunk has been rapidly expanding across the Asia-Pacific region and the Hong Kong announcement comes just five months after construction commenced on a 60MW+ hyperscale data centre in Singapore. AirTrunk’s two Australian hyperscale facilities, SYD1 and MEL1, have been operating since 2017, servicing some of the largest enterprises in the world.\n\nAirTrunk CEO and founder, Robin Khuda said, “AirTrunk’s new Hong Kong facility will be a valuable addition to our growing hyperscale data centre platform, serving one of the most important financial markets in the Asia Pacific, and offering our customers a consistent experience across the region.”\n\n“The new data centre is a result of strong customer demand for our market-leading hyperscale solutions that allow us to deliver the speed, scale and efficiency that our customers need to enable their growth.”\n\nThe state-of-the-art USD$150+ million facility, named AirTrunk HKG1, will be a retrofit of an existing eight storey building and is specifically designed for hyperscale cloud, content and enterprise customers.\n\nMichael Juniper, Deputy CEO said, “Hong Kong is a key hub for international internet bandwidth and connectivity, and a termination point for more than 10 international submarine cable systems. Like all AirTrunk data centres, the Hong Kong facility will be carrier-neutral and have multiple fibre paths.”\n\nThe company’s investment in Hong Kong over the coming years will bring significant benefits to the local economy and create a large workforce during construction and ongoing operations. The initial 20MW facility will provide a solid platform for further expansion in Hong Kong, servicing both local and international customers.\n\nMr Juniper added, “AirTrunk will be implementing a range of design innovations to ensure an industry-low power usage effectiveness (PUE) and high power density. Like our other facilities, HKG1 is designed to meet the stringent security requirements of our customers.”\n\nENDS\n\nAbout AirTrunk\n\nAirTrunk is a hyperscale data centre specialist creating a platform for cloud, content and large enterprise customers across the Asia-Pacific region. The company develops and operates data centre campuses with industry leading reliability, technology innovation and energy efficiency.\n\nAirTrunk’s unique capabilities, designs and construction methodologies allow it to provide customers with a scalable and sustainable data centre solution at a significantly lower operating cost than other providers.\n\nAirTrunk is a private company that is well capitalised to fund its development of data centres across Asia Pacific.\n\nFor more information on AirTrunk, visit www.airtrunk.com",

    text: "Thai hotel developer Erawan Group is set to expand its portfolio in Thailand and overseas, with the aim of becoming the leading budget hotel operator in Asia-Pacific by 2025.\n\nAs part of a five-year plan (2021-25), the group targets to raise the number of its Hop Inn hotels in Thailand to 100 from the current 46, which will bring the total room count from 3,600 to more than 7,200.\n\nAt the same time, the group has finalised deals to double its portfolio in the Philippines from five to 10 hotels, adding 937 rooms to the existing 843. The new properties will be situated in Cebu, Ortigas, Davao, Iloilo and North EDSA. An additional five new projects are underway.\n\nErawan Group’s president Petch Krainukul said the budget hotels will serve mainly the respective domestic markets, ahead of the large-scale return of international guests, which he predicts will not manifest until 2023.\n\nHop Inn holds bright prospects: Its only major rival in Thailand is the B2 Hotel brand, while it ranks among the top three players in the Philippines’ budget hotel sector.\n\nShifting its focus to overseas markets is the fourth phase of the group’s growth plan set into motion since 2016, following a focus on the luxury segment (before 2005), diversifying into other brands (2005-10), and moving into budget including the creation of Hop Inn (2011-15).\n\nBesides Thailand and the Philippines, the group is also eyeing opportunities to acquire properties in other countries as well as seeking to raise three billion baht in capital to drive expansion.\n\nIn 2020, the group logged an accumulated loss of 1.71 billion baht (about US$57 million) due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBudget hotels like Hop Inn are predicted to recover ahead of other segments. While the group’s major luxury flagship hotels including Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok, JW Marriott Bangkok and Renaissance Koh Samui Resort and Spa have been suffering from the decline of international visitors, its economy and budget segments have seen improvements.",

Francis will be flying LATAM during his papal journey.\n\nBy the end of 2018, LATAM hopes to be serving Tel Aviv. Flights would originate in Santiago, Chile, stopping en route at São Paulo before heading out over the South Atlantic to Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport. This route is subject to governmental approval.\n\nSticking closer to home, during the South American summer of 2017- 2018, LATAM is primed to open a route to Chilean Patagonia, at Puerto Natales to be specific.\n\nPuerto Natales is 70 miles (112kms) from Torres del Paine National Park, a place so sublime that VirtualTourist labels it the ‘Eighth Wonder of the World.’\n\nLATAM will employ an A320 on the flight from Santiago. In January and February there will be a quartet of weekly flights.\n\nAll these routes add up—especially the intercontinental long-hauls. Once they’re launched, LATAM will fly to 144 destinations in 27 countries.\n\nSince the onset of 2016, it has launched service on 26 international routes including Lima- Washington, DC and Santiago-Melbourne.\n\nThe westbound Santiago-Melbourne leg takes about 15 hours and is flown by a 787-9. That makes it the longest nonstop ever in LATAM’s history.",

This would involve innovating and co-creating new applications, processes, and services with organisations to better service their end customers or stakeholders.\n\nNCS NEXT in Melbourne is part of the company’s NEXT Innovation Triangle which also includes nodes in Singapore and Shenzhen and draws on the strengths each city brings in terms of talent, clients, and innovation.\n\n“We have witnessed the increasing pace at which both public and commercial sectors in Australia are adopting a digital-first approach to transforming the way in which we live and work,” said Andre Conti, head of NEXT Solutions, Australia.\n\n“Through the NCS NEXT Cloud CoE launch in Australia, Optus Enterprise and NCS can help Australian enterprises and government agencies leverage cloud-based innovations to unlock competitive advantages and enhance customer or citizen experiences,” said Conti.\n\nAlso, a memorandum of understanding was also signed with the State Government of Victoria represented by Invest Victoria as well as the Department of Treasury and Finance.\n\nThis partnership leverages the CoE to promote innovation in cloud, reach new customers, drive talent development, and advance Victoria’s competitiveness in the technology sector.\n\nNCS aims to grow the local team to 1,500 and create 500 new digital skilled jobs over the next few years to support the needs and aspirations of the Victorian and national ICT communities.",

    text: 'The partnership comes at an "opportune moment", according to Spiible\'s CEO. Photo: Spiible\n\nEducation consultant Huatong International has announced a partnership with Latin American agency Spiible, accompanied by a “significant equity investment”.\n\nThe figure that Spiible has received as part of the deal remains undisclosed.\n\nHTi has a large presence as an educational consultant across the world in all four major study destinations, and will work with Spiible to “expand the network of offices” in Sydney, Vancouver, Toronto, LA and New York.\n\nA new major city, which has not been revealed, will also see a new office opened to “recruit Spiible students” with the support of HTi.\n\nSpiible has been a fast growing agency in more recent years, especially in LATAM and South East Asia – something HTi will look to capitalise on.\n\nThe deal marks the “beginning of a powerful alliance in the international student recruitment and marketing sector within LATAM”.\n\nSpiible, which is also shortly launching a new tech arm, will continue to operate under the name, but will go forward with co-branding involving HTi.\n\n“In light of our strategic initiatives and expansion plans, the timing of the HTI/Spiible partnership is particularly opportune,” Spiible co-founder and CEO, Mauricio Segura, told The PIE.\n\n“The collaboration aligns seamlessly with our vision to integrate recruitment technologies into new territories across Latin America and other regions.\n\n“For example, in the coming days we will launch one of 2024’s most innovative initiatives – www.Spiible.tech, a niched tech course marketplace and community.”\n\nMark Lucas, CEO of HTi, will also join the Spiible board, joining Segura and Spiible COO Gabrielle Ruggi Neto.\n\nLucas is slated to play a “crucial role in ensuring robust representation and recruitment” for both companies and HTi’s institutional partners.\n\n“As we embark on the journey of 2024, Spiible is not merely embracing change, we’re orchestrating a crescendo of dynamic growth and influence in the international student recruitment and marketing sector,” Segura added.\n\n“The timing of the HTI/Spiible partnership is particularly opportune”\n\n“Our collaborative efforts extend beyond mere student recruitment. We are committed to aligning our tactics and strategies to unlock enhanced value in these focus markets.\n\n“This alignment is not limited to the institutional level but extends to a broader market perspective.\n\n“Moreover, drawing on the expertise and innovation of our creative sister company, Platty.tech, we will infuse unique and inventive elements into the initiatives we develop, enriching the collaborative endeavours and further distinguishing our approach in the international student recruitment landscape.”',

    text: "Endava has announced the next stage of its partnership with Google Cloud, marking a significant development in its continuing expansion across Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe partnership will see Endava offering more tailored products and services within the Google Cloud suite.

    text: "That expansion strategy, which focuses on the APAC market, includes the ambitious target of reaching 100 million phone numbers on its network by 2030.\n\nAfter the telco takes up the Symbio brand from 1 July, customers will be able to make use of the company’s suite of capabilities, which includes number porting, outbound calling and domestic call termination.\n\n“TNZI has a long and significant history in New Zealand, with its origins tracing back to the pioneering telegraph lines that connected the country with the rest of the world,” said Symbio CEO Rene Sugo.\n\n“We are proud to inherit and carry this important legacy of innovation as we continue to grow our business in the Asia Pacific region.\n\n“The consolidation of TNZI into Symbio is another proof point of our vision to support our customers with delivering the highest-quality cloud communication services.”\n\nThe provider said the decision to consolidate the brand under Symbio was two-fold; the first is that the rapid growth in software-enabled communications has removed traditional geographical barriers that it claims have historically limited service providers to their domestic market.\n\nMeanwhile, the second is that the provider has observed that the demand for international voice, unified communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) and contact centre-as-a-service (CCaaS) solutions has “increased dramatically”.\n\n“Operating as a clear unified business will make it simpler for customers and partners to enter into and operate in different parts of the world,” Sugo said.\n\n“Australian telecommunications providers are increasingly serving their customers overseas, and at the same time overseas communication providers are wanting to enter the high-growth Asia Pacific region.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time a Symbio-related entity has consolidated its name, with MNF Group, which previously was the parent company of Symbio, taking up the communication provider’s brand and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) ticker code of SYM in November 2021.",

    text: "PayU, known as the PayPal of emerging economies, made a double bet in Latin America to expand its presence: it bought the mobile payment platform Ding and led a US$46 million investment in Treinta, a financial app for small businesses. Both are from Colombia.\n\nPayU is the fintech bet of the Dutch investment firm Prosus, with operations in more than 50 countries.“Our recent activity in Colombia reflects PayU‘s desire to provide seamless online and cross-border transactions for merchants and consumers,” said Mario Shiliashki, PayU’s global CEO, in a press release.\n\nDing provides products for businesses to accept payments with debit cards, credit cards, and QR codes. Also, it makes it possible for those who use their services to sell phone top-ups and digital content. These could be favorable for PayU to integrate into its platform of products. PayU did not disclose the price of Ding’s purchase.\n\nFor its part, the recent raising of Treinta led by PayU was a US$46 million Series A. Investors such as LionTree Partners, Ethos VCT, and EN13 also participated. According to data from Crunchbase, with this latest round, the startup accumulates US$60.8 million in funds.\n\nWith a year and a half in the market, Treinta has previously been backed by Y Combinator, Levels Up Ventures, Outbound Ventures, Luxor Capital, Mango.vc, Goodwater Capital, Soma Capital, First Check Venture, Houston Angel Network, FJ Labs, Commerce Ventures, Rhombuz Ventures, Acacia Venture Partners, and Evening Fund.\n\nCurrently, Treinta has around four million customers, many of them small businesses from 18 countries.\n\n“By acquiring and investing in businesses like Ding and Treinta, both global and local SMEs are able to expand their business within LatAm, providing the best payments service with the consumer experience first in mind,” said Francisco León, PayU’s CEO for Latin America.",

    text: "Publicis Groupe has announced a major expansion of creative agency Le Pub, opening offices in Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Singapore and China.\n\nLe Pub is opening an office in Mexico City, as well as in Brazil and China / Unsplash\n\nThe agency - launched in 2020 following the merger of Publicis Italy and teams from Publicis’ data, media and technology teams - will piggyback on the global Heineken business to expand its footprint.\n\nBram Westenbrink, global head of Heineken brand, said in a statement: “Over the last 18 months, Le Pub has helped further Heineken’s relevance and topicality. Its expansion will drive further impact across more of our key markets; ensuring a proven data model combined with world class creativity that powers campaign localisation at scale.”\n\nLast year, Publicis saw significantly more growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East and Africa than the US or European markets. Latin America had organic growth of 16.8%, almost twice that of North America.\n\nLe Pub Mexico, based in Mexico City, will be led by chief creative office Diego Wallach and chief strategy officer Isabella Mulholland; the former was responsible for Mexico’s second-ever Cannes Grand Prix last year. Le Pub Brazil, based in Sau Paulo, will be led by CCO Felipe Cury, managing director Ana Heranndes and head of strategy Silvia Paes. Offices in Singapore, Shanghai and Cape Town are set to roll out over the next two months.\n\nBruno Bertelli, global CEO of Le Pub and CCO of Publicis Worldwide, said the expansion would bring the Le Pub model to new markets. “We live in a world where the interaction with brands and the path to purchase is seamlessly integrated into our everyday experiences.\n\n“In a cookie-less world, brands have to enrich people’s lives to be accepted into everyday culture and this is where creativity is critical to add a premium value to clients. Le Pub is born out of an eclectic community of people, who thrive on connecting creativity with culture and we are excited to see its organic growth globally.”\n\nAs well as Heineken, Le Pub’s clients include Coca-Cola, Diesel and Netflix. Milan-based Bertelli was named the top chief creative officer in the world in this year’s World Creative Rankings, buoyed in part by his agency’s work for the Dutch brewer.\n\nIn February, he discussed how the agency’s creative practice had changed and adapted during the two years of pandemic.",

    text: "LATAM Airlines Brazil has joined its Chile-based parent company LATAM and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States. Meanwhile, the parent company LATAM gained enough funds to weather the current pandemic.\n\nThe Brazilian subsidiary began its voluntary reorganization process in order to restructure debts and fleet while still continuing to fly, stated a press release by the company.\n\n“LATAM Airline Brazil’s decision is a natural step in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic,” the statement read. The bankruptcy proceedings would allow the company to access Debtor-In-Possession (DIP) financing. The São Paulo, Brazil-based airline hopes this would provide the means of financing to operate and adapt to a new reality.\n\nMeanwhile, LATAM confirmed that it has received two tranches, that amount to $2.2 billion in additional funding. Tranche C, comprising of $900 million, was committed by Qatar Airways and two shareholder families. Tranche A, $1.3 billion, was committed by Oaktree Capital Management, but still has to be approved by the Court of the Southern District of New York.\n\nA further $250 million would be added from shareholders from Chile, once the court approves their participation in the proceedings.\n\n“LATAM has taken a significant step in ensuring its operational continuity by securing the commitment of Oaktree Capital Management and its affiliates for the total financing of Tranche A. We hope that, together with Tranche C, it will be approved by the court in the coming weeks,” stated Roberto Alvo, the chief executive officer (CEO) of LATAM Airlines Group.\n\nThe support of the two principal shareholders has been essential, added Alvo, as this helped the airline group “to secure all the resources that are required to continue operating during the crisis” and exit Chapter 11 proceedings.\n\nLATAM Brazil will still pursue state aid, as it continues negotiations with Brazil’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), indicated the company.",

Together, they aim to deliver unique and exclusive content experiences to passengers on LATAM’s onboard entertainment platform, ‘LATAM Play’. The content is intended to reflect LATAM’s identity: “Latin American roots with a global reach.”\n\n“This agreement is a continuity of three successful years working together,” said Jaime Cornejo, Director of Cabin Interior & Inflight Entertainment, LATAM. “We are happy to continue working with Touch.

    text: "Today, Miroma Group’s digital development sub-division, Miroma Project Factory (MPF), officially partnered with the augmented reality (AR) social media firm Snap Inc. The move provides Snapchat with its first official Australian Creative Partner, expanding the AR platforms development presence in the APAC region.\n\nMPP is joining Snap’s Lens Studio ecosystem as an official creative partner allowing the Australian firm to work directly with Snapchat to build engaging AR social content. The partnership also enables MPF to provide its creative and technical experience for internal Snap brands distributing AR campaigns on the social media service.\n\nThe Snapchat Creative Lens Partner group is a program that enables Snap to leverage expertise and resources from an exclusive international lineup of APAC immersive tech thought leaders and experts. The program helps Snap distribute high-quality branded immersive content on Snapchat and its AR hardware ambitions.\n\nAmber Clarke, the Marketing & Client Success Manager at MPF, explained what the firm could bring to the Snap developer ecosystem:\n\nWe are excited to become a Snapchat Lens Creative Partner and look forward to using our creativity, innovation and expertise to enhance experience and build great value for our clients. We are especially thrilled to use some of Snapchat’s newer technologies like Spectacles.\n\nMoreover, Clarke noted that MPF brings an extensive experience in AR campaign development to the table. MPF leverages visualisations, immersive filters, and micro-games to distribute user-friendly AR content. The Manager also noted the MPF is “looking forward to bringing our clients’ products to life.”\n\nMPF has experience building gamified interactive products and experiences for the entertainment, broadcast, and healthcare sectors. The firm has deep knowledge of engagement and behavioural change within an interactive experience, providing its partners with valuable information regarding user attention.\n\nIs Snap a Good Investment for Brands?\n\nIn May, social media stocks dropped across the board. The overall share declines included significant industry players like Meta, Google, and Snap Inc. Following the marketplace decline, many analysts questioned the future of current leaders and the general focus on immersive extended reality (XR) products.\n\nFor example, Meta is dropping some of its XR products following an internal reshuffle. Despite its refocus, the firm released the awaited Meta Quest Pro in October. Some still criticised the high price points, while others praised the hardware’s mixed reality (MR) capabilities and display technology.\n\nOn the other hand, AR platforms seem to retain support amidst a somewhat unstable marketplace. AR remains an accessible avenue for brands, developers, and users to access immersive content.\n\nInternational audiences experience AR content via social media content like simple branded filters and interactive experiences. Equally, many major high-street retailers are employing AR applications to reengage with customers and redefine the buyer’s journey. Brands also use in-store and digital immersive solutions to enhance re-life purchases with immersive content.\n\nIn a conversation with XR Today in October, the Founder of European Snapchat Studios partner GoSpooky, Tim Van Der Wiel, explained that Snapchat remains a viable marketing platform. Despite Snapchat laying off 20 percent of its 6,400 employee workforce in August following a disappointing Q2 earnings report.\n\nThe Founder said that Snapchat is a “huge” opportunity for marketers within the AR space. He believes that Snap owns the best AR technology, which the firm scales across the most active users.\n\nTim Van Der Wiel says roughly 250 million people use AR experiences on Snapchat daily. He also mentioned that the service’s active user base is more extensive than “every other platform out there, and this space is wide open for marketers.”",

      "Wunderman Thompson expands mentoring app across APAC ahead of global expansion",
    text: "| BY Ricki Green |\n\nIn the UK, Magpie engaged 50% of the agency’s women in the first week alone, with 20% continuing to use the app each week to connect with a mentor. Those who have been mentored on the app are already returning the favour, with growing interest in becoming a mentor and a 15% increase in mentor sign ups since launch. The app was awarded the accolade of ‘Best Talent Development Initiative’ in The Drum’s Awards for Agency Business 2022. Magpie has since been expanded to all Wunderman Thompson UK’s talent.\n\nOriginally launched in the UK on International Women’s Day in 2022, the app was created by RISE, Wunderman Thompson UK’s women’s network, and was born from a desire to create a self-serve platform to form connections and support Wunderman Thompson’s women who account for 50% of the agency.\n\nCalled Magpie, the app’s purpose is to empower and connect women across the business using a matchmaking style app based on each individual mentor’s expertise and knowledge. Complimenting longer-term mentoring schemes available in the industry, Magpie connects women for peer mentorship on specific/individual needs, featuring 15 themes ranging from maternity and motherhood, leadership, building your personal brand and managing stress.\n\nAfter a successful pilot scheme across the agency’s APAC offices, Magpie will launch to the region’s talent on 8th March, supporting their women’s network Ladybirds, which aims to strengthen representation and gender parity across the region through networking, mentoring, events and knowledge sharing.\n\nSays Lindsay Shirley, chief people officer for Wunderman Thompson APAC: “As senior leaders, we have an obligation to mentor and support women to build their careers and thrive at Wunderman Thompson. Many women have wanted a mentor but not known where to find one, Magpie has helped us bridge that gap and we’re thankful to RISE UK for it.”\n\nSays Supria Dutta, head of talent for Wunderman Thompson APAC and Ladybirds member: “We are excited to bring Magpie to our region on International Women’s Day. This unique peer mentorship app has the potential to build bridges between women on all levels and potentially open doors for active sponsorship.”\n\nSays Evie Nagy, senior account manager and co-lead of RISE at Wunderman Thompson UK: “Having seen the success of Magpie in the UK, it only seems fitting that Magpie is spreading its wings once again this IWD. It’s been great to connect with our teams in APAC, and learn about their specific mentoring needs, and how Magpie can help. I’m immensely proud of what we’ve achieved with Magpie and how its aided in women’s career and personal development. As we said last year, it’s only the start as we have exciting plans for the year to come.”\n\nMagpie’s expansion across APAC is the first step in a wider plan to offer access to the app across Wunderman Thompson’s 20,000-strong global network.\n\nThe Magpie branding was devised by senior creatives Charli Plant and Laura Saraiva. Explaining the idea behind the name the team says: “The Magpie platform lets our talent steal pieces of shiny advice from lots of different people, with different experiences across the agency. And for the superstitious amongst us, it just so happens that two magpies together bring good luck and joy!”",

    text: "| BY Ricki Green |\n\nFollowing a hugely successful first five years in Amsterdam, production-led creative agency Whale has expanded its global footprint by opening an APAC offering based in Melbourne. Australian co-founder and executive producer Rachel Perry has returned to her hometown after 15 years to open the APAC office.\n\nWhale joins a new generation of creative agencies in the APAC region offering alternative and agile ways for brands to connect with consumers, make world class creative work and deliver on business goals.\n\nAustralian-born Perry (pictured above right) co-founded Whale with business partner and executive producer Ezra Xenos (above left) from New York, after they met working in Amsterdam at Sid Lee. They both worked for 10 years in production departments at various brands and agencies in Amsterdam, including Nike, 72andSunny, Wieden+Kennedy, 180 Amsterdam and Anomaly.\n\nPerry and Xenos founded Whale five years ago to work at the nexus of business, craft, creativity and production. Their flexible model comprises in-house experts and specialist collaborators that are curated to each brief according to its needs, all focused on delivering creative excellence efficiently and effectively. With its production-led approach to every brief, Whale has delivered global campaigns for a range of clients across multiple sectors, including adidas, Diageo, McLaren, Montblanc, Netflix, Nike, Polaroid, Samsung, Turkish Airlines, AJet, and WeTransfer.\n\nAbout her return to Australia, Perry says: “It’s been an incredible experience to live in Europe for so many years, to launch Whale at a time of such industry change, and now to expand to Australia. I’m excited to be back in Melbourne, not only to be closer to family and introduce my children to everything Australia has to offer, but also to establish Whale’s APAC HQ. I’m bringing with me a wealth of global experience which will shape our approach here. We’re going to be helping our clients shift towards more bespoke and efficient ways of working with multiple collaborators, along with dynamic methods of optimizing creativity to solve business problems.”\n\nXenos says of Whale’s expansion: “This is the latest exciting step in continuing to evolve our global offering for our partners. There are a wealth of creative opportunities throughout the APAC region and we’re hungry to get stuck in. Having Rachel in Melbourne is going to be a benefit to our existing and future clients. We look forward to being a part of the creative community in APAC and helping to drive the quality of work throughout the region. I’m continuing to lead our business based in Europe and the States, and as always, Rach and I will be partnering on client projects.”\n\nPhoto by Paul Barbera",

    text: "WildBrain CPLG, a global leader in entertainment, sports, and brand licensing, is expanding its global strategy, beginning with a focus on Asia Pacific (APAC). Its new location-based entertainment (LBE) company will develop opportunities for the firm’s franchise brands, such as Teletubbies and In the Night Garden, and partner brands which include Peanuts and PLAYMOBIL.\n\nThe LBE company launch follows the announcement of a series of major partnerships and projects with Max-Matching, one of the leading international entertainment companies in Asia. Max-Matching is a highly regarded developer, investor and operator of international cultural and IP visitor attractions.\n\nWildBrain CPLG welcomes Kevin Suh & Evi Sari\n\nKevin Suh is collaborating with WildBrain CPLG to develop the global LBE strategy. A veteran licencing executive, Suh’s responsibilities include driving significant opportunities around the world from his base in Los Angeles.\n\nSuh was formerly president of themed entertainment and consumer products at Paramount Pictures, where he oversaw location-based entertainment worldwide for all Paramount Global brands. This included Paramount Pictures, CBS, Nickelodeon, and others, with key franchises including SpongeBob SquarePants, Star Trek, PAW Patrol, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nHe was responsible for more than 20 Paramount Global-branded entertainment locations and programmes around the world, including theme parks, hotels and resorts, restaurants, retail companies, and stage performances. Suh also has experience as a senior executive at the Motion Picture Association of America and as a lawyer.\n\nIn addition, WildBrain CPLG welcomes Evi Sari to the senior leadership team in China as vice president of location-based entertainment. Sari is based in Shanghai and will manage the agency’s LBE strategy in APAC and the GCC. This role includes responsibility for driving regional prospects for WildBrain’s franchise brands, such as Teletubbies, Strawberry Shortcake, Inspector Gadget, and In the Night Garden, as well as third-party brands like Peanuts and PLAYMOBIL.\n\nSari has been working on diverse entertainment projects for over 15 years. Her experience ranges from cultural attractions and theme parks to resorts and family entertainment centres (FECs) with worldwide IP studios and significant state-owned developers. She was previously the vice president of Location-Based Experiences at Paramount (ViacomCBS), where she was in charge of developing partnerships to turn Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, and CBS franchises into real-world experiences across Asia.\n\nMaarten Weck, WildBrain CPLG’s EVP & MD, comments: “Location-based entertainment creates another tool for brands in our 360-degree offering as part of the global WildBrain organisation, bolstering our integrated capabilities across content creation, audience engagement and global licensing. LBE is a fast-growing segment globally, with APAC being a key opportunity, and we have big ambitions in this space.\n\n“With Kevin’s global LBE experience and Evi’s highly impressive expertise in APAC, we’re perfectly placed to help brands capitalise on the significant and growing opportunities this sector presents.”\n\nThemed hotel rooms & FECs\n\nThe firm has been developing new projects in China, with deals being agreed on behalf of Peanuts Worldwide for Peanuts, and WildBrain Ltd. for Teletubbies and In the Night Garden with Max-Matching. FECs and IP-themed hotel rooms will also be developed for each brand in Beijing, Zhongshan City, Guangdong, and a further city.\n\nThe IP activations are scheduled to roll out over five years and will be among the features of brand-new shopping, entertainment, and leisure venues in Beijing and Zhongshan. These initiatives will include IP experiences in sizable mixed-use commercial developments created for Chinese families to interact with treasured entertainment brands.\n\nMax Matching is a major LBE licensee in China and with fast growth in the Asia Pacific region. The firm’s comprehensive knowledge of the China market and its consumers ensures long-term success, as data and creative solutions provide seamless product adaption, curation, development, and execution. The projects will energise vital areas of the region.\n\nThe FECs will be part of the planned Beijing Municipal Administrative Centre Cultural Tourism Area. This will include a new 100-hectare retail and entertainment complex, close to the Universal Beijing Resort. The FEC in Zhongshan will be part of the waterfront commercial development, which will feature high-rise towers, a convention centre, five-star hotels, and luxury homes. This location is under development in the Greater Bay Area, a special economic zone in South China which connects 11 cities, including Hong Kong, Macao, and Shenzhen.\n\nOpportunities in the APAC region\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when LBE opportunities in the APAC region are expanding rapidly. AECOM’s 2021 China Theme Park Pipeline Update states that China is now the world’s second-largest theme park market, and this rate of growth will likely continue. 80 new theme parks are set to open by 2025, representing a combined sector investment of around US $47bn.\n\n“We’re delighted to partner with Max-Matching on LBE activations in China for Peanuts, Teletubbies and In the Night Garden,” says Sari. “They are an organization with a deep understanding of international IP and high-quality, location-based entertainment, as well as strong strategic relationships and cooperation agreements with major developers and government stakeholders.\n\n“Their new projects have premium locations in Beijing and Zhongshan, making them ideal destinations for children and families to visit and enjoy popular entertainment brands. Our new LBE business is off to a great start, as we continue to enhance WildBrain CPLG’s offering to brands and partners around the world.”\n\nOwen Zhao, president of Max-Matching, adds: “Max-Matching is committed to bringing world-level top IP experiences to China. We are immensely proud to announce our collaboration with WildBrain CPLG, who bring deep expertise in IP licensing and a strong understanding of what it takes to interpret beloved IPs such as Peanuts, Teletubbies and In the Night Garden into real-world experiences to establish strong emotional connections with guests.\n\n“With the rapid development of China’s economy and rising demand for high-quality leisure and entertainment experiences, Max-Matching is excited to explore further collaborations with WildBrain CPLG on outdoor theme parks, FECs, themed hotel rooms, themed F&B and retail. We look forward to potentially expanding our partnership in the future to create diverse branded offerings that will be anchor family attractions in urban mixed-use destinations in China.”\n\nWildBrain CPLG is the first global licencing firm to offer in-house LBE services. The announcement follows the agency’s recent APAC growth, which included new locations and teams in Seoul, Taipei, Manila, Bangkok, Mumbai, and Singapore, as well as an extension of its existing Shanghai team.",

    title: "Slack expands footprint in APAC",
    text: "Slack has expanded its footprint in Asia-Pacific with a new office in Singapore to tap into the region’s growing demand for cloud-based collaboration software.\n\nSpeaking to Computer Weekly on the sidelines of Salesforce Live in Singapore, Slack’s country manager for the city-state, Shweta Verma, said that in less than three quarters, the local office has grown its headcount to 30 employees, underscoring the growth momentum in the region.\n\nSalesforce completed its $27.7bn acquisition of Slack in July 2021, bringing the latter’s collaboration capabilities to its suite of cloud-based applications used by sales, commerce, IT and customer service teams. Technology analyst firm Gartner described the buyout as a revolutionary move that would position Salesforce more strongly and broadly in digital workplaces and employee experience.\n\n“We’ve been very fortunate that we got the benefit of Salesforce’s investment into Slack to fast-track our product roadmaps, and to hire and show our commitment to the region,” said Verma.\n\nFor a while, Slack’s Asia-Pacific footprint was concentrated in Australia, one of the most mature markets in the region for cloud-based collaboration tools, from which it peddled its software to other customers in Asia.\n\nBut with the “hyper-growth” that Slack had seen on the back of half a million users, even without fielding sales reps in the region, Verma said the company gained the confidence to invest in local teams after the Salesforce acquisition was completed.\n\nSlack’s Singapore office follows the launch of its Indian outfit last year, but the city-state remains the epicentre of its growth in the region. “Some of our largest marquee wins have come from the likes of home-grown Singaporean companies like Grab, which has more than 24,000 employees now using Slack,” said Verma.\n\nBeing in Singapore – a regional financial hub with a vibrant financial technology startup landscape – has also opened up opportunities for Slack to penetrate the financial services sector, which accounted for the bulk of its customer wins in the last quarter, she said.\n\nRead more about IT in APAC Globe Telecom has moved its on-premise data warehouse to Snowflake to address scalability challenges and improve customer experience.\n\nAiven grew its business in Asia-Pacific by over 100% over the past year and is now building new capabilities in data warehouses and other areas.\n\nThe Meteorological Service Singapore is getting a new Cray supercomputer to improve weather forecasting and tropical climate research.\n\nMedibank Private recently suffered a major data breach involving the personal and health information of millions of customers, once again casting the spotlight on data security in Australia.\n\nFollowing the launch of its Singapore presence, Slack has hired a team in Thailand and will soon build a team in Singapore to serve customers in other Southeast Asian markets, such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, said Verma.\n\nAs a sales executive, Verma has experienced first-hand the benefits of the tighter integration between Salesforce and Slack. For one, she no longer spends hours conducting forecast calls with her team – instead, she creates automated workflows for her team to submit sales forecasts, which are, in turn, rolled up into a report that she can easily pull up.\n\nThe synergy with Salesforce is already drawing more customers to Slack. Verma said in the last three quarters, almost 40% of Slack’s customers have been Salesforce customers.\n\nThat said, she noted that nearly 76% of Slack’s clients are also customers of other tech suppliers that compete with Salesforce. “That’s the beauty of Slack – it has a great fan base from Salesforce, but at the same time, we are quite product-agnostic in the sense that we coexist with the likes of Microsoft and other competitive players.”\n\nThat is where integrations with other business applications become critical and necessary for non-Salesforce customers to benefit from Slack’s workflow automation capabilities.\n\n“Developers love us because it’s so much easier for them to build and code within the app as well as integrate with in-house applications that they have,” said Verma. “We encourage that, especially for our large enterprise customers, for which we also have professional services teams to help them.”",

    title: "Artyzen readies for APAC expansion, including Singapore and China",
    text: "Hong Kong-based Artyzen Hospitality Group has unveiled its ambitious expansion plans with the announcement of seven pipeline projects across mainland China and Singapore by 2023, while plans to roll out its forth hotel brand are already in the works.\n\nSince its inception in 2013, the group has been expanding and currently operates six hotels. It will be launching seven properties under the Artyzen Hotel and Artyzen Habitat brands in Singapore and across mainland China, including Qiantan Shanghai, Lingang Shanghai, Taopu Smart City Shanghai and Hengqin Island in Zhuhai, over the next two to three years.\n\nArtyzen hotels 1 of 3\n\nArtyzen has also partnered Lujiazui Group to build two integrated developments, which will include residential properties, convention centres, cultural centres and hotels.\n\nMeanwhile, the hotel group has plans to introduce another new lifestyle brand before December 2019. Artyzen Hospitality Group’s president Robbert van der Maas told TTG Asia that this select service brand will offer limited service and relatively small rooms. The first property will debut at a new CBD in Shanghai with about 220 rooms. The deal is still under non-disclosure agreement and will mark the launch of its fourth brand.\n\nThe company’s current portfolio of brands are luxury brand Zitan, Artyzen Hotels and Resorts, and Artyzen Habitat.\n\nHowever, Zitan hasn’t been rolled out in markets yet. Van der Maas explained: “As a young hotel company launched six years ago, we are still developing and looking for the right opportunities and locations for Zitan. The first Zitan may take another two to three years to launch as we are actively looking at destinations like London, Paris and New York.\n\n“For our Artyzen brands, we don’t want commodified experiences or duplicate products so we curate and celebrate the differences between our hotels within the same brand. In fact, these brands can also co-exist together, so we adopt a dual-brand execution. You might have two hotel brands under the same site and cater for two different markets,” he said.\n\nApart from this, the group also focuses on developing a cluster of hotels in one country at a time. The first cluster is located in Macau – Grand Coloane Resort and Grand Lapa.\n\n“We’re now building a hotel on the border of Hengqin Island in Zhuhai which will mark our third hotel in this cluster. In the meantime, discussions about opening a property in Zhuhai are underway and we are also looking at Hong Kong,” Van der Maas said.\n\n“Next, we are planning to expand into the Greater Bay Area, i.e. Dongguan and Guangzhou. Likewise for Shanghai, we are looking at Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou to start building the first cluster of our properties.”\n\nVan der Maas added that the company will be developing two hotels in Qiantan – Artyzen Habitat and Artyzen New Bund 31, which is a multi-purpose destination.\n\nArtyzen Hospitality Group is also undertaking its first hotel in Singapore with the development of Artyzen Cuscaden Singapore in the Orchard neighbourhood.\n\nThe group also has longer-term plans to grow its global footprint, and is exploring opportunities in Australia, Japan, the Maldives, South-east Asia and Portugal, according to van der Maas.\n\nArtyzen Hospitality Group will be operating 13 hotels, with close to 3,000 rooms in Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Macau and Hawaii, including those under construction.\n\nUpdate: The story headline earlier stated that the Artyzen Hospitality Group will be bringing the Habitat brand to Singapore. It should be a Artyzen Hotels and Resort brand. The headline has been updated to reflect the group’s expansion in Asia-Pacific.",

    title: "Ares to Enter Japan as APAC Expansion Continues",
    text: "NYSE-listed Ares Management is expanding its footprint in Asia with plans to establish an office in Japan next year, as it moves to explore real estate and buyout opportunities in the country.\n\nA representative from Ares confirmed to Mingtiandi that the US fund management titan will establish its next base of operations in Japan, with the move reportedly having been under consideration since at least August of last year.\n\nAres chief executive officer Michael Arougheti had first revealed the news earlier in the week in an interview with Nikkei Asia. “We expect to open our office here in Tokyo in 2024,” Arougheti said. “I believe there is probably a more robust private equity and real estate opportunity here in Japan than credit.”\n\nWith $12.2 billion in assets and around 555 employees across APAC, the base in Asia’s second largest economy will increase Ares office count in the region to ten locations, with the company already established in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Korea.\n\nAsian Market Expansion\n\nArougheti’s nod to Japan’s near-term promise for Ares’ private equity and real estate strategies points to one of the world’s largest private credit investors adjusting its approach to fit the Japanese market.\n\nThe firm’s third quarter results show that assets under management for Ares’ credit strategy amounted to $268.9 billion at the end of September, over twice as much as the combined holdings of its $34.3 billion private equity strategy and the $63.9 billion in AUM for its real assets division.\n\nWith a new Tokyo office on the way, Ares is continuing to grow its presence in Asia after the firm completed the acquisition of Singapore-based private equity firm Crescent Point Capital in July. The company had ramped up its Asia operations in January 2020 when it secured a controlling stake in Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management, which was then renamed Ares SSG, and later came fully under the Ares Management identity.\n\nIn addition to its APAC buyout strategy, Ares made its first direct investment in Hong Kong real estate in September of last year when it purchased a 51 percent stake in a Kowloon office project from local builder New World Development for HK$3.07 billion (now $393 million).\n\nSeven weeks before the Hong Kong investment, Ares appointed Bryan Southergill, a former KKR executive, to lead the firm’s real estate business in Asia.\n\nAside from real estate, Ares closed its sixth Asia special situations fund in October at $2.4 billion, including a sidecar vehicle, according to the company’s third quarter earnings call. The 2022-vintage strategy targets distressed sales in China and India, thanks in part to a $75 million commitment from the Colorado Public Employees’ Retirement Association.\n\nNew Operations in Japan\n\nAres’ decision to open a new office in Japan aligns with a series of moves by some of the world’s largest fund managers to boost their presence in the country.\n\nIn July private equity firm Warburg Pincus enhanced its presence in the Land of the Rising Sun and reconfigured its Asia leadership by appointing Takashi Murata as head of Japan and co-head of Asia real estate, with that appointment set to take effect in early 2024.\n\nGoldman Sachs also appointed a new leadership group for its Japan business in November, according to Bloomberg. The shift saw the investment bank’s long-time president of Japan, Masanori Mochida, stepping down and a squad of five younger executives promoted to lead in what is seen as a period for growth by global investors in the country.\n\nApollo Global Management also announced in December last year that it had appointed former Citigroup Japan chairman Tatsuo Tanaka as the new chair for its business in the country.\n\nWith the island nation benefiting from low interest rates, and with the yen having slid against the US dollar, fund managers have been scooping up assets in the country, with Blackstone last week having finalised a deal to acquire a Kyoto hotel from Goldman Sachs for a reported $54 million.\n\nIn August, UBS Asset Management launched a multi-family development project in east-central Tokyo that is estimated to be worth $230 million once completed. The Zurich-based firm said that the project in Koto ward will have 563 units across 18 floors on a 7,000 square metre (75,347 square foot) site, making it UBS AM’s largest rental residence effort in Japan.\n\nInvestment in commercial property in Japan surged 40 percent to JPY 2.7 trillion in the first nine months of this year, at the same time that it fell 50 percent worldwide, according to a recent report from JLL.",

    text: "LATAM Brasil announced that its first Boeing 777-300 aircraft has entered into regular operation with the company's new, remodeled cabins.\n\nThe PT-MUD prefix aircraft will be responsible during the month of July for flights LA8064, which departs daily from São Paulo/Guarulhos at 22:55 pm to Madrid, Spain, and LA8065, which is the return route.\n\nIt is the first aircraft to arrive in Brazil with the new configuration and the second of the LATAM Airlines Group that operates long-haul flights (wide body).\n\n“We are showing all the strength of LATAM in this massive investment in onboard comfort. On the Boeing 777, we have the most modern executive cabin in the country with comfortable seats that recline 180 degrees (full flat) and offer free access to the aisle, providing total privacy, in addition to individual 18-inch screens”, says Jerome Cadier, CEO of LATAM Brazil.\n\nThe Boeing 777-300 of LATAM Airlines Brasil was rebuilt in Abu Dhabi and, by the end of the first quarter of 2020, all nine other units of the same model in the company's fleet will be transformed.\n\nThe cabin renovation project for 200 aircraft, approximately two-thirds of the LATAM Group's global fleet, is the largest investment in the company's history in customer experience, approximately US$400 million.

    text: "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nUS / Brazil: Travel tech marketplace Mondee has announced the acquisition of São Paulo-based B2B travel provider Interep [Interep Representações Viagens E Turismo S.A.] for $8.9 million.\n\nMondee, which went public via a special purpose acquisition company [SPAC] merger with ITHAX Acquisition Corp last July, will use the acquisition of Interep to further expand and diversify its geographic footprint in Latin America, enhance its product offerings, and provide a complementary distribution network to that of Orinter [Mondee’s previous purchase in Brazil].\n\nThe company is seeking to drive change in the leisure and corporate travel sectors through a broad array of innovative solutions.

It has a total of US$10.7 million in funding, which is helping to launch its operations in Colombia.\n\nKatoo is an app that allows both suppliers and restaurants to control their orders, minimizing errors and streamlining processes. This way, according to MuyPymes, restaurants are able to save about five and a half hours a week when placing orders, and up to 6% in costs.\n\nThe platform also provides data and reports so that restaurants can identify what products they consume and improve their negotiations with their suppliers.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Katoo also launched a simplified and centralized payment service in Europe. It wouldn’t be odd to see it in Colombia in the next few months.\n\nBefore arriving in Colombia, Katoo had annual transactions of US$250 million and more than 7,000 restaurants and suppliers, a figure it wants to surpass after 2022, its CEO told Forbes Colombia.\n\nThus, after starting operations in Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and the Caribbean Coast, Katoo already has its sights set on Chile, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador, and Argentina.\n\nYou may also be interested in:",

      "Mexican Delivery Startup Calii Raises US$22.5 Million for Expansion in LatAm",
    text: "Calii is a grocery delivery startup originally from Nuevo León, Mexico. They operate as a supply chain capable of bringing thousands of grocery items to its users’ doorsteps in less than two hours.\n\nIt recently received US$22.5 million dollars in a Series A. This was led by Dalus Capital and JAM Fund, with the participation of some investors such as Forerunner Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, Y Combinator and Base10 Partners. With this investment, Calii has raised almost US$35 million dollars.\n\nAfter this survey, Calii will begin a new phase of growth, expanding its presence in Mexico and the rest of Latin America. Their plans include covering 14 cities and multiple countries in the next six months. In addition, the company is launching new products and categories, such as a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service offering Calii Pay. With this financing offer, it is expected to exceed 10,000 daily orders.\n\nIts founders, David Arrambide and Maurizio Caló, are both engineers who graduated from Stanford. Calii works as a mobile supermarket through an application that connects the main producers and brands with customers, thus automating the supply chain. The company uses micro automated fulfillment centers and algorithms that manage to make demand more efficient.\n\nThe products with which they began to operate were fruits and vegetables. Later they began to expand their business to meat, seafood, prepared items, groceries, etc. By cutting out middlemen, Calii reduces efficiencies and manages to generate more profits for producers. There are also big savings for its users. Calii’s prices are currently on par or lower than traditional chains like Walmart.\n\nThe difference that Calii wants to highlight compared to other delivery startups such as Jüsto, JOKR, Cornershop or Rappi is in the prices, speed and reduced catalog of groceries and ultra-fresh products.\n\nCalii’s growth has been exponential since its creation in 2019. During the last 12 months, the company has tripled its income. It now makes more than 2,000 deliveries a day and its number of collaborators increased by 250%.\n\nAccording to the AMVO Online Sales Study 2021, e-commerce in Mexico reached US$316 billion pesos in 2020; that is, it grew 81% compared to the previous year. Due to this, it already represents 9% of total retail sales, making the online supermarket a category that has gained ground in the digital universe.\n\nYou may also like: Q&A | Supermarkets Had Not Evolved in More Than 40 Years: Alejandro Sisniega, Co-founder of Jüsto",

    text: "Hilton is ramping up its manpower and portfolio growth in Asia-Pacific destinations such as India, Myanmar and China.\n\nThe group has invested a full suite of staff – from new offices to leadership changes – to build up its base in India, and is planning to make further inroads with the launch of the Conrad brand in Bangalore and Pune, said Alan Watts, president, Asia-Pacific.\n\nHe shared that Hilton plans to double its footprint in the country within the next five years.\n\nChristopher Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton, said: “We are going into very large business in India. We have 17 hotels open there and an equal amount in the pipeline.\n\n“We’ve made some progress (since previously) we did not have the right relationships or leadership to be successful, but we have both of these right now. Although the economy is really good in India, it’s complicated (to open hotels), so we have to be disciplined and focused.”\n\nIn Myanmar, Hilton opened a third property in March this year, and reportedly has two more hotels in the pipeline for Bagan and Inle Lake.\n\nMeanwhile, the group will launch a holistic strategy in China to meet the growing demand from the middle-class market.\n\nNassetta explained: “The emerging middle class around the world is indisputable. We still have a luxury strategy in China with Waldorf Astoria and Conrad, but the bulk of demand growth will be from the mid-market. We have extended-stay brands like Tru, which is in the US and will likely arrive in this part of the world in the not-too-distant future.”\n\nMidscale brands already available in Asia are Hampton by Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn. For the luxury market, Hainan and Sanya are soon to welcome a Waldorf Astoria property each, while 11 Conrad sites are now under construction in China.\n\nIn South-east Asia, where Hilton derives nearly 40 per cent of revenue from F&B outlets, the hotel giant has launched a training programme for F&B and culinary department staff across 37 hotels.\n\nThe F&B Operations Academy will run for seven months each year, and comprises a series of webinars hosted by seasoned F&B practitioners in Hilton, as well as a workshop facilitated by training provider TMI Consultancy.\n\nIn its inaugural year, the programme saw participants from six countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The F&B Operations Academy workshops will continue to be rolled out across South-east Asia over the course of the year.",

Because garnets produce very little dust, the mineral is beginning to replace silica in abrasives due to the health dangers surrounding silica.\n\nFor over four decades, GMA has been at the forefront of garnet abrasives development, consistently improving its products to meet evolving customer needs.\n\nIt is, according to the company, the only global garnet producer to manage its complete supply chain from mine to customer.

GMA said the Malaysian hub has met all quality assurance measures and will begin shipping products to customers by the end of the month.\n\n“Our new, fully stocked facility will ensure excellent service and fast shipping for our Asia Pacific customers,” GMA general manager of international sales and marketing Flynn Cowan said.\n\n“This new distribution and packaging hub allows us to streamline our processes, maintaining the high standards of quality and reliability that GMA is known for globally.”\n\nSubscribe to Australian Mining and receive the latest news on product announcements, industry developments, commodities and more.",

      "Beauty and bones: Singapore marine collagen drink firm Dahmeh re-brands and innovates to fuel expansion",
    text: "The firm’s jelly beverage highlights how marine collagen can aid the maintenance of skin elasticity, nourishes joints and ligaments, reduce signs of ageing and strengthen the body.\n\nFor the re-branding process, its founder Ng Lew King, an optometrist for 20 years, has introduced a new line with zero fat and sugar named Willow Green after undergoing more than six months of R&D. The line targets individuals 30 and above.\n\nDahmeh founder Ng Lew King © Dahmeh\n\nBefore this, Dahmeh offers the beverage with additional ingredients, like monk fruit (luo han guo), lemongrass and brown sugar.\n\n“We need to expand, and it is hard to expand, especially for liquid products. The COVID-19 pandemic has already made (the business scene) quiet. We were also quiet for two years. ​\n\n“Now, we have plans to expand overseas through re-branding our beverage to Willow Green, which is more flexible. People from other countries may not like the older versions, for instance, the one with lemongrass.​\n\n“Once we settle the export licence and necessary documentation, we want to expand to Indonesia, China, UAE and Saudi. UAE and Saudi are great markets because we have the halal certification, and the consumers there do not have the variety of choices,” ​said Ng, 68 years old.\n\nNg, who established Dahmeh in 2018, decided to create the beverage after consuming a complimentary fish-scale jelly dessert, which was not on the menu of a Singaporean Chinese restaurant.\n\n“I was born in Kedah (northern Peninsula Malaysia) and noticed that the villagers make a home-cooked version. But you might only get the scales’ gelatine, not the collagen. They also add rock sugar and try to mask the fishy smell. Commercially, firms usually use fish skin or powders originating from bovine or porcine sources,” ​she said.\n\nOn the other hand, Dahmeh uses seabass scales, and it maintains the content of 8,000mg of collagen in each glass bottle of 130 millilitres. The scales, which she claims come from a sustainable source, hail from an Asian country which she declined to reveal.\n\nAccording to Ng, consumers need at least two months of consumption to notice a difference. Individuals with kidney or health issues must consult a physician first before consuming.\n\nIn a paper​ unrelated to Dahmeh, a team of researchers from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) of Singapore in November 2017 analysed type I collagen extracted from fish scales as a potential alternative source of collagen for tissue engineering applications.\n\nThe team also acknowledged that the most common sources of collagen are of bovine and porcine origins, although the industrial use of collagen obtained from non-mammalian species is growing in importance, particularly since they have a lower risk of disease transmission and are not subjected to any cultural or religious constraints.\n\nDahmeh’s odourless jelly can be drunk on its own, mixed with an effervescent vitamin C tablet or honey, added to ‘cheng tng’ (loosely termed as ‘clear soup, but refers to a traditional hot or cold dessert widely available in Singapore and made with a myriad of ingredients like sago pearls, white fungus, red dates and pearl barley) and meat soups.\n\nSix bottles retail at SGD$99 (USD$70) with 20 vitamin C tablets via e-commerce websites like Qoo10, Lazada and Shopee. The package was launched on Mothers’ Day on 8 May.\n\nIntensive improvement​\n\nConventionally, Dahmeh utilises an OEM foodtech factory to produce around 400 to 500 bottles daily. However, it started using retort technology to extend the shelf life of its product in 2019. Then, the beverage could last anywhere from 18 to 24 months, said Ng.\n\nWith additional assistance offered by the joint facility FoodPlant​ in Singapore, Dahmeh aims to scale up to produce 3,000 bottles daily.\n\nNg pictured with Executive Director of Trinox Engineering Services Henry Tan, the supplier of the retort machine that Dahmeh uses at FoodPlant. © Dahmeh\n\n“To produce 100% collagen is challenging. It’s a troublesome process; it is not from a powdered source or has flavouring. We have to cook the scales, sieve and bottle them. The process is complex.​\n\n“With a small factory, I cannot scale up.

    text: 'FoodNavigator-LATAM caught up with Giulia Braghieri, head of business development at Chilean plant-based start-up NotCo at Food Tech Summit in Mexico City.\n\nNotCo’s mayonnaise is made with chickpeas while its milk is based on cabbage and pineapple concentrate – something Braghieri recognizes is somewhat “outside of the box” - ​but that is all down to the company\'s artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm.\n\n“We have an algorithm called Guiseppe […] that has a database with more than 400,000 plants,"​ she said. "He analyses the animal-based product at a structural level and then gives us a variety of formulas that we replicate in our laboratory with our chefs.”​\n\n“The reaction between both of them leverages lactone which gives a mouthfeel sensation of milk. We also use aromas to get a similar [taste] to milk, and all of them are natural.”​\n\nIf your aim is to disrupt the food sector and make plant-based products the norm, it may seem strange to start with mayonnaise, a condiment that doesn’t make up a massive part of people’s everyday diet. But NotCo had its reasons.\n\n“It’s a Chilean founded company and Chile is the third country that most consumes mayonnaise in the world per capita so it made sense to start with this category. It’s also a low entry category when you think of investments in factories.​\n\nThe next entry we wanted to do was milk because it’s a huge market in all the countries we were looking at – Brazil, Argentina and Chile. And after we had the milk, anything that derives from milk was the next no-brainer for us.”​\n\nWatch the video to find out more.',

Disney and Kodansha have worked together in the publishing space, and will now venture into the world of anime.\n\nThe expanded collaboration will include licensing exclusive SVOD anime titles based on manga produced by Kodansha. These will begin with “Tokyo Revengers: Christmas Showdown Arc” that will launch exclusively on Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar in Jan. 2023.\n\nYoshinobu Noma, Kodansha representative director and president, said: “The special relationship between Kodansha and Disney stretches back over 70 years, and has seen us bring to life many Disney licensed publications. With today’s announcement, we are thrilled to be able to further diversify and elevate the relationship between our two companies and share even more of our beloved anime titles with the world on Disney+ and its streaming platforms.”\n\nCarol Choi, executive VP of original content strategy, The Walt Disney Company APAC, added: “We are thrilled to deepen our strategic collaboration with our long standing partner Kodansha on such an exciting genre. Japanese anime fills the white space in our content development plans and we believe this expanded collaboration will be a game changer in Disney’s future animation strategy in Japan. We look forward to bringing the anime titles and prized IP by Kodansha to the world stage.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMeanwhile, at an event at Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands convention center on Wednesday, Disney is revealing a host of titles, with some 50 shows from its 2023 theatrical and streaming content slate being presented to over 400 international press and partners. The new projects unveiled are part of Disney’s ambition to greenlight over 50 APAC originals by 2023.\n\nAttendees include Japanese director Miike Takashi, Korean stars Jung Haein, Ko Kyungpyo and Kim Hyejun from the crime fantasy thriller “Connect”; Lee Donghwi, Heo Sungtae and acclaimed director Kang Yunsung from “Big Bet”; Yuya Yagira, Riho Yoshioka and director Katayama Shinzo from Japanese drama series “Gannibal”; and Chelsea Islan from the upcoming Indonesian superhero series “Tira.” Pixar’s director-animator-storyboard artist and voice actor Peter Sohn, director of feature film, “Elemental,” will also be at the event.\n\n“Last October, at our first APAC Content Showcase, we made our first step into local content production with an ambitious, long-term plan to uncover the world’s best stories from this region, and to showcase creative excellence that can shine on the world stage,” said Luke Kang, president, The Walt Disney Company Asia Pacific in his opening remarks. “This year, it was important for us to showcase the breadth of our global branded content from our award-winning studios and iconic franchises, as well as our APAC content slate for 2023.”\n\nOver the last year, over 45 new APAC titles have debuted on Disney’s streaming service. The total hours of locally-produced Asian content streamed on Disney+ is eight times more than it was a year ago, the company said.\n\n“We are focusing our content development on what we refer to as our content white space,” Kang said. “Investing in areas that require more local specificity – either due to high popularity in select markets, like Japanese Anime, K-Dramas or Indonesia rom-coms and horror, or the need for local storytelling with talent that are familiar to our local audiences. We want to serve our viewers in every market with globally branded content like Disney, Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar, as well as locally produced stories that resonate with them – while also taking the best of those stories global.”\n\nDisney’s streaming services now reach over 235 million subscribers across 154 markets worldwide.",

However, the AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) region is due to launch, changing this by opening large-scale data centres that can deliver low-latency, high-speed transmission services from local storage to customers in Taiwan.\n\nFrom its global data centres, AWS delivers a full range of cloud services, including computing, storage, databases, analytics, robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Some of the top businesses in Taiwan have started to process workloads using AWS services. These include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Chunghwa Telecom, Cathay Financial Holding, Acer, Trend Micro and Gamania Digital Entertainment.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, AWS’s vice president of infrastructure services, emphasized that the new AWS region in Taiwan will empower businesses to harness cloud technology and take full advantage of AWS’s comprehensive service offerings.\n\nIn simple terms, an AWS region is a cluster of interconnected data centres within a geographical area. AWS, which has now expanded to 105 availability zones in 33 geographic regions worldwide, will open the new Taiwan zone. An availability zone is an isolated location within a region that contains one or more data centres with redundant power, cooling, and physical security facilities.\n\nThe expansion will cover a broad spectrum of entities, including developers, startups, companies, non-profits, and educational institutions, as well as businesses in other industries, such as entertainment and financial services. This will provide them with more locations to deploy their applications and serve users from data centres in Taiwan. AWS also stated that it will continue to allow customers with a pressing need to store their content within Taiwan to retain their content locally.\n\nThe cloud service provider plans to invest billions of dollars in Taiwan over the next 15 years, underscoring its long-term commitment to the region. This significant investment is a testament to the strategic importance of Taiwan in AWS’s global expansion plans, making the audience feel valued and significant in the global tech landscape.\n\nAWS’s expansion in Taiwan comes amid a larger push in the Asia-Pacific region. In March, the company said it would invest at least $6 billion through 2037 to create a new region in Malaysia. They also announced in October 2022 a plan to invest $5 billion over 15 years in Thailand. These two announcements follow the December 2021 launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Region in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nTop tech firms are also churning out massive funding in the APAC region. The government seeks to expand its digital economy and attract high-technology companies with the hope of forming a tech hub in Malaysia. Google said it will spend $2 billion in the country to build its first data centre and cloud region in Malaysia. Microsoft also announced plans to invest in AI and cloud initiatives in Malaysia, as well as similar deals in Thailand and Indonesia, as part of a renewed focus on Southeast Asia.\n\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, AWS leads the cloud infrastructure services market with a 31% market share in the first quarter of this year. This places Microsoft’s Azure in second, highlighting how the cloud industry is arguably the hottest sector in all of technology right now.\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

    text: "Authorities in Peru have arrested an Italian accused of being a major cocaine trafficker for the ‘Ndrangheta, further evidence of the growing reach of the Italian mafia into cocaine source countries and transshipment points across Latin America.\n\nPasquale Bifulco, alias “Spaghetti,” was arrested in Lima following two years of investigations into his activities in the country. He is wanted by not only by the Italian authorities, but also those of Brazil and Spain, and is allegedly one of the principal cocaine providers for the ‘Ndrangheta’s European market, reported La Republica.\n\nIn addition to reportedly leading operations that moved large amounts of cocaine from Peru and Brazil to Europe via cargo ships, authorities discovered through intercepted phone calls that Bifulco had bought a 35 percent stake in a gold and iron mine in Peru to launder drug money.\n\nAccording to La Republica, Bifulco’s sister Florinda and his Peruvian girlfriend — both of whom are under investigation — headed up the financial end of his operations.\n\nBifulco allegedly maintained operations in 12 countries, and had managed to evade capture on at least two recent occasions — in January 2012, he was followed and nearly arrested in Rome, while an operation in March this year led to the detention of numerous of his collaborators, along with the seizure of over two tons of cocaine.\n\nInSight Crime Analysis\n\nThe ‘Ndrangheta, who authorities say are responsible for up to 80 percent of cocaine moved to Italy, have long had a presence in Colombia, where they collaborated with the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) in the 1990s and the Medellin Cartel before that. They have also developed significant business relationships with Mexico’s cartels.\n\nBifulco’s arrest comes amid a number of signs that the ‘Ndrangheta and their Sicilian counterparts, the Cosa Nostra, are expanding operations to other countries in the region. The brother of an alleged leader of the Cosca Alampi — a smaller mafia group linked to the ‘Ndrangheta — was arrested in Ecuador last November, while a Cosa Nostra boss was apprehended in Venezuela in 2012. There have also been reports of an Italian mafia presence in the Dominican Republic since 2007, and an alleged key ‘Ndrangheta operative was recently captured on the island, which is a major cocaine transshipment nation.\n\nSEE ALSO: Coverage of Latin and European organized crime\n\nMeanwhile, the March operation that nearly caught Bifulco was the product of an investigation that had uncovered an ‘Ndrangheta-led operation trafficking cocaine out of Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.\n\nBy expanding into Peru and Brazil, the group could be looking to reduce the role of middlemen; if they operate throughout the region, they can secure product closer to the source and personally oversee trafficking through the various transshipment points.",

With a proposed scale of 1.21 hectares, the sites for potential use currently stand as the Cyberjaya and Kuala Lumpur’s Central Business District, although no official announcements have yet been made.\n\nAs part of the Damac Group, Edgnex, otherwise known as Damac Data Centers, is responsible for the current development of facilities across Dammam and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, with plans for extension of another data center in neighboring Amman, Jordan. Those sites located in Saudi Arabia aim to offer 55 mW capabilities by 2025. To support development, Damac has recently signed an agreement to construct a data center as well as a cable landing station at King Abdullah Economic City in Saudi.\n\nPlans for a new data center campus in Dublin have been halted following the liquidation of Dataplex, one of the land owners, following denial of the company power contracts at two locations. However with potential expansion to Europe, initial plans have been mentioned for Italy, Germany and Spain.",

The funds will go toward developing regional businesses and launch services in Chile.

In addition to the recent launch of Virgin Mobile Chile, VMLA has targeted the launch of operations in seven further markets, including Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. VMLA said it would specifically target the youth market segment, Virgin Mobile’s natural audience.\n\nThe new funding for VMLA also consists of equity from existing shareholders, including the Virgin Group and ePlanet Capital. But among the new investors, Juan Villalonga, former CEO of Telefonica S.A. and co-founder of Hermes Growth Partners has been the first to join the VMLA board of directors with immediate effect.\n\nCommenting on the new funding, Phil Wallace, chairman of VMLA, said that\n\n“Virgin Mobile Latin America is just beginning its expansion across the region. We are making rapid progress… The new funding from this very distinguished group of investors supports VMLA’s vision of establishing a multi-market regional footprint”.\n\nSouter Investments is the private investment vehicle of Brian Souter, founder of Stagecoach Group.

    text: "Global data driven communication platform for the creative industries Little Black Book (LBB), today announced the next stage in its international ambitions by appointing Toby Hemming as its first APAC managing director. The move marks an on-the-ground expansion into Asia-Pacific.\n\nLaunching officially into APAC is a logical move for LBB. Across 2022, LBB will be putting feet on the ground in key regions for its membership base which spans over 75 countries worldwide. In APAC, this will accelerate a rapidly growing audience and membership-base of companies hailing from the marketing, communications and creative industries.\n\nSydney based media professional Toby Hemming has joined to run LBB APAC as its first local MD, leading the commercial and strategic direction of the platform. His appointment follows an international career in both agency and brand communications including roles as head of marketing and communications at WPP AUNZ, eight years as founder and MD of APAC media and tech communications agency BOLD, and senior roles within both News Corp and BSkyB.\n\nUnder Toby’s commercial and strategic leadership, LBB will, for the first time, introduce a dedicated local newsletter and a round-the-clock web presence to highlight the region’s exceptional creative work, along with insights, profiles and opinions.\n\nIn addition, he will be the on-the-ground APAC lead for LBB’s B2B PR service, LBB Lab. Toby will seek to amplify and attain more business for the rapidly growing PR department which offers bespoke written content and B2B marketing strategy for brands, agencies, production companies, VFX houses, post production businesses and more. His appointment is the first of a number of new hires for LBB across the region, with plans to build a dedicated team of editorial, PR and commercial staff over the next year.\n\nLBB APAC MD Toby Hemming said the news was an important moment for creatives across Asia-Pacific. “Having known Matt and LBB for some time, I have been consistently impressed by the hard work and dedication of partnering with the creative community for the common good. Creative talent across the AsiaPac region is amongst some of the globe’s best, consistently over performing on a world stage. Having a common, high quality platform to showcase and inspire is a great resource, and something I know the industry both respects and responds to. Having the opportunity to join the team in this pivotal role is a brilliant way for me to build upon my professional experience to supercharge the LBB community across the region.”\n\nMatt Cooper founder CEO and founder LBBOnline added: “Over the past three years, LBB has experienced rapid growth. It is clear to us that our local / global model works and has become invaluable to many businesses and readers in the creative worlds. We have members in over 75 countries worldwide but the appetite we are experiencing in these countries can only grow. With confidence behind us, we are investing in putting exceptional talent on-the-ground in key markets across 2022 - starting with AsiaPac. This is not only to provide our existing community with the best minds and tools to help them grow their businesses, but to show those who don’t know us how we can help them grow opportunities and fame.\n\n“Toby is one of those exceptional people we’re bringing on board. His understanding of what it takes to make businesses in our industry heard is unrivalled and his experience in corporate communications in-market in AsiaPac is invaluable to the development of the wider offerings of LBB - the creative archive, the Immortal Awards and the Lab. Our aim is as simple as ever, to help many more celebrate and communicate the great work they do, daily.”",

    text: "LATAM Airlines Group is expanding its usage of drones for aircraft inspections following successful tests in Brazil.\n\nThe airline was the first in Latin America to deploy Donecle drones in 2020, following a three-month trial at its MRO facilities in Sao Carlos, Brazil. It has been testing the drones for exterior inspections of aircraft fuselages at the site, where the technology takes thousands of detailed photos and uses artificial intelligence to identify potential damage and possible required repairs. According to LATAM, preliminary results of the tests have shown that the drones reduce inspection time from eight hours to 40 mins.\n\nNow, LATAM plans to extend drone testing to its maintenance center in Santiago, Chile.\n\n“At LATAM we see this technology as an opportunity to improve and optimize our aircraft maintenance and inspection processes,” says Marcos Melchiori, LATAM’s senior manager of MRO in Sao Carlos. “We are constantly looking for new tools that allow us to establish more efficient and precise processes, with the safety of our passengers and collaborators as the top priority.”\n\nIn addition to drones, LATAM has also rolled out augmented reality glasses in its maintenance operations for inspections and remote technical support. It began implementing AR ‘SmartGlass’ equipment in April at 20 company bases in Brazil. A LATAM representative says it is the first airline in Latin America to use the equipment.",

      "Is Leidos leveraging Australia as a staging point for APAC expansion? – ARN",
    text: "US-headquartered defence IT specialist Leidos could be leveraging the phenomenal growth it has seen in the Australian market as a springboard for an expansion across the broader Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar merger between Leidos and Lockheed Martin’s government IT services business in 2016 saw Leidos Australia grow almost overnight from a 60-strong tech player to a firm with almost 800 people under its belt.\n\nThe merger also saw the local Leidos brand instantly become one of the largest prime systems integrators servicing Australia’s federal public sector market.\n\nSince then, the company’s Australian operation has carved out what seems to be a relatively extreme niche for itself, with a strategic focus on just a small handful of major federal government entities, including the Department of Defence (DoD) and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).\n\nIndeed, Leidos is working with Fujitsu and US-based partner KBR on a three-year, A$175 million program to upgrade and modernise IT and communications systems for the DoD.\n\nThe program will see Fujitsu, KBR and Leidos support about 70,000 users including troops in the field, ships at sea, and joint headquarters and support bases deployed domestically, regionally and globally.\n\nSo successful has Leidos been in Australia that, in 2020, between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of the company’s US$1 billion in overseas sales revenue derived from the country, according to John Caucis, senior analyst at industry analyst firm Technology Business Research (TBR).\n\nFurther, Leidos’ 2020 increase in international revenue, up 17.5 per cent year-to-year, was driven largely by aggressive growth in Australia, Caucis said, claiming that the company was primed for continued rapid expansion in the country and across APAC more broadly as it leverages Australia as a staging point and case study for future regional expansion.\n\nCaucis also noted that Leidos was opening a new software development factory in Melbourne that will create 100 or more IT jobs and will be the company’s first such facility outside the United States – another sign, he said, that the company expects steady growth in Australia for many years to come.\n\n“Leidos has a 20-plus-year history serving clients in Australia, including the national government and provincial authorities, the nation’s healthcare sector, the intelligence community, and the country’s border defence agencies,” Caucis said in a blog post, suggesting Leidos was well positioned to take advantage of some of the latest investment pledges by the federal government.\n\n“In 2020 Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison affirmed over A$270 billion (about US$190 billion) in new defence outlays over the next decade, including defence IT modernisation and upgrades to weapons platforms,” Caucis said, pointing out that this spending comes amid a backdrop of Australia’s relations with China becoming increasingly strained in recent months.\n\n“Leidos is ideally positioned to capture a large share of the expected budgetary investments to modernise defence platforms and civilian IT infrastructures,” he said.\n\nFrom Caucis’ perspective, Leidos’ Australian operations make the company relatively unique among top-tier federally centric IT integrators and professional services vendors, at least regarding the scale and tenure of its business in the Australia and New Zealand region.\n\nFor example, Raytheon Intelligence & Space – another major defence contractor – derives nearly 40 per cent of its US$19 billion backlog from international markets and 12 per cent of its total revenue (about US$800 million in 2020) from APAC (not exclusive to Australia).\n\nHowever, Raytheon does not provide traditional enterprise IT services to the Australian government or other foreign government clients in the region, Caucis said.",

    text: "Specialist climate, tech and finance PR agency, Third Hemisphere, has announced plans to expand into APAC, appointing ex-M&C Partners chair and Stockhead co-founder Jonathan Younger as advisory chair, Mumbrella can exclusively reveal.\n\nOver the past twelve months, Third Hemisphere has grown from four to 16 employees, expanded its offerings and won numerous new clients, among other big milestones.\n\nAccording to founder and managing director, Hannah Moreno, “the time felt right” to expand and embark on a new challenge.\n\n“We had all of these things ready to go, and we’ve taken on investment, so the natural next step was to expand our geography,” she told Mumbrella. “What we realised is that a lot of our clients needed broader support in APAC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Climate change is not siloed to Australia. A lot of Australian climate change and tech companies look overseas to see what other regions are doing, and we want to help them reach a wider market, and South Asia is the place for that,” she said.\n\n“And on the flip side, we also want to be able to service South Asian brands that are looking for expansion and coverage in Australia.”\n\nMoreno explained the next six months will be launching, setting up clients and helping her new hires settle in.\n\n“We want to launch in Singapore in the coming months, and want to have our first ten fintech and climate tech clients there. We do want to try and get larger companies – we’re aiming for a few unicorns – because we want to make a name in the region and hit the ground running,” she said.\n\n“And obviously we’ve just made some big hires, and we want to help them settle in, and also continue that trajectory of growth and hire some of the best people in APAC.”\n\nJeremy Liddle, executive director at Third Hemisphere told Mumbrella that the long term goal is to “become the number one specialist climate, tech and finance PR and marketing agency in APAC”.\n\n“It’s ambitious, yes, but we want to see ourselves working with the biggest climate tech companies,” he said. “We’re already getting asked to come in on some 20, 30, 40 million dollar transactions, to we want to keep that momentum going.”\n\nJoining the team to assist in its expansion, is former Media & Capital Partners chairman and Stockhead co-founder, Jonathan Younger.\n\nHe was one of four recent senior appointments, joining the agency as advisory chair.\n\n“I’ve been an admirer of Jono for years,” Liddle explained. “And I just thought he’d be perfect for us, so we got him.\n\n“He’s the kind of advisor that most entrepreneurs dream about.”\n\nAlso recently appointed is Laura Morelli, who joins as media director.\n\n“Laura is a PR guru,” Liddle said. “She brings such a wealth of knowledge with regards to media.”\n\nGlen Barry will serve as Third Hemisphere’s new creative director, while Jeffrey Coote is its new content director.\n\n“Glen’s a creative genuis,” Moreno told Mumbrella. “He’s branded over 300 companies – including the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the City of London, even the country of Estonia’s official branding.\n\n“Bringing him on board is just brilliant for us.”\n\nLiddle continued: “And Jeffrey, he’s an ideas factory. He’s got over 25 years experience across journalism, PR, investor relations, content management, and he will be critical to our client base.”\n\nMoreno said: “We’re very pleased to have brought in a wide range of talent to help us showcase our clients’ immense impact to the stakeholders critical to their success. This will help scale their incredible innovations, improving millions of lives around the world in the process.”\n\nYounger said: “Of my various private investments, only one is in a public relations company – Third Hemisphere.\n\n“Observing the team’s huge potential as their advisor prior to this investment, I quickly realised the potential for growth, and for Hannah and Jeremy to grow into future industry leaders.\n\n“I strongly believe in the empowering and inspiring culture of the company, and its vision of positively impacting millions of lives globally by elevating the work of their world-changing clients.”\n\nAs part of the expansion, Third Hemisphere is also solidifying its diversified offerings – including integrated marketing and branding.\n\n“We were nailing the PR for our clients – giving them huge amounts of credibility, exposure, really creating value for them. But we did notice a lot were lacking in their branding and marketing,” Moreno explained.\n\n“So we thought by combining those, they get to have us as PR experts, but also use our strategic thinking in branding and marketing.”\n\nOther recent client wins include global mid-market private equity firm, The Riverside Company, green hydrogen startup HydGene Renewables, Australian climate advocacy group for parents, Parents for Climate, Australian climate conference and events platform, ImpactX, and payments provider, Monoova.",

    title: "Koto expands into APAC, opens Sydney office",
    text: "Brand and digital studio Koto has expanded into the APAC region, opening a Sydney office with Damian Borchok and Gerald Torto at the helm.\n\nThe announcement:\n\nBrand and digital studio Koto, has officially launched its Sydney office, marking its expansion into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Damian Borchok, former For The People co-founder and CEO, Interbrand Australia CEO takes on the role of managing director APAC, and Gerald Torto, previously with Re part of M&C Saatchi Group, joins as senior strategy director.\n\nThey will lead the new office and regional efforts, with a senior creative leader joining the leadership team in the next months. The studio’s initial focus will be on expanding its presence in Australia, India, Singapore, and South Korea. This strategic move reflects Koto’s continuous growth as a leading brand and digital studio spanning the EU, US, and now APAC.\n\nFounded in 2015 by Caroline Matthews (COO), James Greenfield (CEO), and Jowey Roden (CCO), Koto has enjoyed an impressive trajectory, growing from a 3-person brand studio to a global powerhouse with a global team of over a 100. With offices in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York, and now Sydney, Koto secured rapid recognition for its transformative rebranding work for Airbnb, led by James Greenfield, Koto CEO, who served as the project’s executive creative director. The studio’s momentum has grown steadily, recently delivering impactful projects for global brands such as Amazon Music, Discord, Glassdoor, Netflix, and Whatsapp. Beyond that, Koto fuels startups with distinctive, culturally relevant brands, exemplified by the likes of Bolt, BackMarket, and Meatable, catalyzing their ambitions to reach new heights.\n\nKoto is dedicated to building optimistic brands that are true, compelling, and distinctive. Their service offering covers three pillars, from brand strategy and identity to digital and campaign work. The studio leverages deep immersion and strategic thinking as the foundation for ensuring relevance and creative excellence in every project it undertakes. This approach has attracted top-tier leaders from tech sectors, spanning both B2C and B2B domains, who seek to shape or reboot their brand identity and narrative.\n\nKoto’s strategic move is bolstered by an accomplished leadership team with a standout local track record. Damian Borchok, with over two decades of APAC experience, held key positions at Interbrand and Landor Australian outposts before launching his boutique studio, For The People. His portfolio includes prominent brands like Culture Amp (Australia), TIMEdotCom (Malaysia), and the iconic Sydney Opera House. Gerald Torto brings a distinctive blend of brand strategy and business expertise, commencing his career in branding at Re, a part of the M&C Saatchi Group, where he served as strategy director. This led him to establish a new practice within Re, dedicated to delivering brand services to APAC tech scale-ups, amassing an impressive client portfolio including Australian brands Weel, Mr Yum, Channel 7 and more.\n\nA third leader, well-versed in regional dynamics, will soon join as executive creative director, rounding out the leadership team.\n\nKoto’s primary focus initially centers on extending its presence across Australia, India, Singapore, and South Korea. While Koto’s local footprint was absent until now, it has already engaged with several APAC enterprises, including Australian-founded Airtasker, a service marketplace and Zip, a buy-now-pay-later fintech, Gumtree, an online classified ads and community site acquired by eBay, operating in Australia and New Zealand, and Korean-based Need, a digital cancer protection system.\n\n”After launching our second US studio in New York just over a year ago, it felt right to set our sights on the APAC region. We’ve worked with a number of APAC clients in recent years and we can see the potential here is immense, with thriving economies and leaders aiming to make their brands global forces. I’ve always believed APAC brands hold untapped possibilities to display their identity, differentiation, and strategic growth,” explains James Greenfield, Koto CEO.\n\n“Exceptional brands shouldn’t be limited to the US – there are a lot of interesting products and services in APAC. Koto steps in with Damian, G, and our upcoming executive creative director, soon to be unveiled. Together, they’re the dream team writing this next chapter with us.”\n\n“Sooner rather than later Asia will be home to 3 of the 5 largest economies in the world. Brands from this region will have global impact like never before. While there are internationally networked branding agencies across APAC, few are yet to bring much of a sense of dynamism, vision or ambition. The region deserves to see more brands that elevate Asia’s growing status and influence — commercially and culturally,” explains Damian Borchok, Koto APAC managing director.\n\n“Koto was born out of the technology and innovation world. Our work is informed by the entrepreneurial drive to build something better. In our case, it’s brands. We’re looking forward to partnering with like-minded businesses and contributing to the exciting times ahead in Asia and the Pacific.”\n\nGerald Torto, Koto’s senior strategy director, shares, “I’m really excited to be contributing to Koto’s vision of building the world’s most iconic brands, in the world’s most iconic places. The opening of a studio in Sydney to service the region is a real signal of intent and too good an opportunity to miss. For me there’s an unmatched optimism and pragmatism to the way the business goes about its work, and that drives an approach to brand strategy and verbal (as well as visual) identity that I feel can make a real difference to the ambitious businesses across APAC.”",

    text: "Tubi, the free ad-supported streaming service owned by Fox, is now available in Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama — an expansion that has doubled its global footprint and signals the company’s interest in capturing more Latin American viewers.\n\nConsumers in these five Latin American countries now have access to Tubi’s library and will be able to watch titles — with either subtitles or dubbed in Spanish — on a variety of devices such as desktops, iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs, LG TVs, Samsung TVs, Roku TVs, Amazon Fire TV Stick devices, VIDAA Smart OS on Hisense TVs, Google TVs and other Android TV OS devices, plus Microsoft Store on Windows. Ecuador is the only country where Roku is not supported.\n\nIn addition to free movies like “The Green Hornet,” “Hellboy,” “American Psycho” and others — viewers in the five countries can also stream regionally produced TV series such as “Bienvenida Realidad,” “Atrapada” and “El Sexo Debil,” plus local versions of “The Nanny,” “Bewitched” and “Married with Children.” Tubi will also offer TV series “L.A.’s Finest” and “Masters of Sex.”\n\nTubi has been slower to expand to other countries than its competitors. Disney+ has launched in more than 80 countries and is aiming for a total of 160 countries by 2023. Netflix is streaming in 190 countries. Tubi is available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Australia, as well as the aforementioned additional five Latin American countries.\n\nTubi’s expansion in Latin America puts it in a better position in the race for world expansion as Latin America is a growing market and a big focus for streaming services. LABS (Latin America Business Stories) predicted that Latin America’s streaming subscriptions will more than double in the next three years, reaching 110 million viewers in 2025. The company told TechCrunch that further expansion in Latin America is not yet determined.\n\n“We’re delighted to launch our platform in these five Latin American countries, bringing viewers a mix of locally-produced content, Spanish-language favorites, and Hollywood titles,” Adam Lewinson, Tubi’s chief content officer, said in a statement. “We’re eager to expand deeper into Latin America after the stellar success of Tubi in Mexico, which has seen tremendous growth in such a short amount of time.”\n\nTubi launched in Mexico in 2021, bringing viewers a localized Spanish-language app in partnership with TV Azteca, a media company in Mexico with four television networks. Tubi boasted in Thursday’s announcement that the streaming service saw total viewing time in Mexico rise 60% year-over-year and total viewers increase 40% year-over-year.\n\nFox reported in its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday that Tubi saw an increase in monthly active users (MAUs) of nearly 40%. In the quarter prior, the streamer announced a total of 51 million active users. Last year, Tubi had 33 million.\n\nCEO Lachlan Murdoch remarked in Wednesday’s earnings call, “We will continue to invest judiciously in Tubi with our sights set on achieving $1 billion in revenue run rate in the next couple of years.”\n\nFox acquired Tubi in 2020 for $440 million and will continue to invest in the platform. In the past year, the service saw a 45% growth in revenue.",

    text: "APRA AMCOS veteran Matthew Fackrell joins Audoo, where he’ll be expected to expand the tech company’s royalty collection processes across Asia Pacific.\n\nBased in Sydney, Fackrell is named senior VP and GM, Asia Pacific, a new role and a new market for the international business.\n\nFackrell’s CV boasts 25-plus years at APRA AMCOS in senior roles across operations, business transformation, music licensing, corporate services and international relations, skills which will come in handy as Audoo looks to “improve the landscape of royalty payments for songwriters and artists in music,” reads a corporate statement.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Fackrell comments, “the issue of getting songwriters recognised and remunerated when their music is played has been something close to my heart, and working with Audoo is a natural extension to that.”\n\nAudoo’s niche is in the space of performance royalty collections.\n\nIts top brass is confident its Audio Meter, which plugs into premises where music is played, is a game-changer which can grow the pie and lift royalty streams to creators.\n\nUsing real-time data, the business works with PROs and collective management organisations (CMOs) to digitise and streamline their processes.\n\nAudoo’s technology solution “serves a genuine need, and solves a real market problem,” Fackrell continues.\n\n“Installing an Audio Meter is just a matter of plug/play/set and forget – making best practice in public performance reporting easy for individual venues, performing right organisations (PROs) and collective management organisations (CMOs). It’s great to have joined a company with a great product, amazing story and fantastic people.”\n\nHe reports directly to Ryan Edwards, Audoo founder and CEO.\n\nAudoo is very much on the expansion path, facilitated by a team stacked with experienced professionals from tech businesses and PROs.\n\nAlong with Fackrell’s appointment, the business taps Eric Nguyen, formerly mergers and acquisitions expert with the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), as senior VP and GM, North America, based in Toronto.\n\nAt Audoo, says Edwards, whose business has been active since 2018, “the mission of revolutionising the public performance royalties space continues.”\n\nWith Fackrell’s and Nguyen’s expertise and regional connections, “we are in the best place to execute our commitment to delivering the most accurate data for public performance around the world,” he continues.\n\n“We look forward to welcoming more international partners, licensees and creators to join us on this industry-changing journey.”\n\nAudoo’s bespoke plug-in is said to be discreet and cuts through foreground noise, to capture a digital, GDPR-compliant, fingerprint of the music, which, ultimately generates royalty cheques for artists and rightsholders with “a much greater level of accuracy,” the company claims.\n\nInvestors have bought in.\n\nThe business raised £5.2million in its 2020 Series A funding round and £7.2million in its pre-series B funding round in 2021.\n\n\n\nFinancial backers include MPL Ventures, Tileyard London, Steve Sidwell, and Björn Ulvaeus, founding member of ABBA and president of CISAC.",

This includes expanding the firm’s existing offerings in content creation and production, as well as adding talent in the areas of social commerce, paid and performance marketing, MarTech, AI, VR and 3D capabilities, among others.\n\nThese new hires will form specialist hubs in India, Greater China, Southeast Asia, Korea and Australia that will operate across geographic borders to service clients in the APAC region, working closely with Edelman’s Data & Intelligence (DxI) unit to deliver more effective integrated communications solutions in an increasingly digital engaged world.\n\nThe firm has also launched Edelman Studios in India, building on the regional studio work already performed in Singapore and Malaysia. By June 2022, Edelman will have over 60 people working in its Studio operations across the region, including a second hub in Taiwan to cater to clients operating in North Asia. Through a hub-and-spoke model, Edelman’s APAC Studio capability will deliver bespoke content solutions for clients at scale, enabling them to connect more effectively with audiences through content.\n\n“Over the course of the pandemic, we’ve seen our clients take significant steps to accelerate their digital capabilities, knowledge and skills.

    text: "SINGAPORE — In a move that will further consolidate Singapore as one of the major fintech hubs, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has granted major payment institution (MPI) licenses to two global players earlier this week; UK-based cross-border payments specialist TerraPay and Canadian fintech leader Nuvei.\n\nThe awarding of an MPI license in Singapore to both TerraPay and Nuvei underscores the company’s ambitions for regional expansion within the Asia-Pacific market. These licenses will enable them to offer a comprehensive range of payment services in Singapore, including domestic and cross-border money transfers, as well as merchant acquisition services.\n\nIn a media statement this week, TerraPay, the first to be issued with the MPI said that with the approval from MAS it is now set to redefine the payment landscape as it caters to the growing demand for efficient and transparent payment solutions in the region.\n\n“Being granted this license by the Monetary Authority of Singapore is a big milestone for TerraPay, especially as we expand our reach and services across geographical borders. This achievement underscores our ongoing dedication to upholding the highest standards of regulatory compliance and reinforces our commitment to providing transparent, frictionless, and simplified payment services.\n\n“As we continue to grow, we’re excited to prioritize the development of strategic cross-border payment partnerships and innovative solutions to help simplify global money movement,” said Sheshagiri Malliah, Managing Director, Terra Payment Services Pte Ltd.\n\nTerraPay now has 11 licenses and 19 regulatory approvals in 30 markets, globally. The company is hoping that it will be able to leverage on Singapore as Southeast Asia’s financial hub, and capitalize on this new MPI license to strengthen existing and new partnerships in the region while also accelerating their APAC presence.\n\nMAS granted MPI license to Nuvei a day later and the company said that it will be able to extend its global reach and enable customers in the region to benefit from the additional service.\n\nNuvei explained that their payments platform allows businesses to optimize operating costs and boost conversion rates. This can be done by consolidating their payments solutions, maximizing payments acceptance, minimizing risk, and enhancing the consumer payment experience.\n\n“Securing this MPI license is another significant milestone as we continue accelerating our growth in APAC.\n\n“This license enhances our service offering for customers in Singapore by enabling us to provide additional payment solutions, including international money transfers through direct card payouts. It also provides another validation of our steadfast commitment to optimizing the payment experience for businesses and consumers throughout this critically important region,” said Philip Fayer, Chair and CEO, Nuvei.\n\nThe Canadian fintech company is ramping up its presence in the Asia-Pacific region, as they aim to support businesses looking to scale both locally and cross-border.\n\nNuvei modular payments platform enables clients to securely connect with customers in over 200 markets worldwide through a single integration, accepting 680 alternative payment methods and offering acquiring in over 50 markets.\n\nThe Canadian fintech firm made headlines recently after private equity giant Advent International announced a US$6.3 billion all-cash deal to acquire the company.\n\nThe Ryan Reynolds-backed firm will become private under Advent International’s ownership, with shareholders receiving US$34 per share in cash. This buyout marks a significant development for Nuvei, following its initial public offering just four years ago.\n\nUnder the terms of the buyout agreement, Nuvei CEO Fayer will hold roughly 24% ownership, while investment firms Novacap and CDPQ will control approximately 18% and 12% of the company, respectively.\n\nNotably, Nuvei’s leadership team will remain intact, with Fayer continuing to lead the business in all aspects of its operations from its Montreal headquarters.\n\nThis structure ensures continuity for Nuvei as it transitions to private ownership, with key stakeholders and current leadership team continuing in the company following the conclusion of the transaction.",

    text: "Independent insurance company manager, Strategic Risk Solutions (SRS), has announced the appointment of Luis Delgado as Latam Regional Director.\n\nIn his new role, Delagdo will be responsible for leading SRS’s business development strategies and the geographical expansion of the firm into Latin America. He has been relocated to Colombia to establish SRS’s presence in the region.\n\nCaptives owned by parent companies from Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Chile have existed for several years. As the region matures in its endeavors with advanced business solutions, such as risk management and captives, the industry continues to grow.\n\nBrady Young, CEO of SRS, commented: “Latin America represents an important region for SRS. We believe there are significant opportunities for Latam parent organizations to make greater use of captive insurance.\n\n“Luis has developed a good foundation of Latam business for SRS operating from Bermuda as well as building on his captive management experience. Relocating to Colombia brings a greater local presence as we bring more support and resources to support captive insurance in the region.”\n\nDelgado joined SRS in 2020 as Vice President of SRS Bermuda captive management operations and responsible for the oversight of SRS’s growing Latam portfolio of clients.\n\nHe has also hel positions at JLT Insurance Management and JLT Group, as well as with Marsh & McLennan and PwC.\n\nDelgado said: “Over the past few years, we have seen record levels of captive formations, feasibility studies, and general interest and enquiries from prospects across Latam, so it makes sense to be closer to where our clients and prospects are located.\n\n“Latam is producing strong growth in captive insurance, and we will focus on developing new captive formations from the region.”\n\nThe news of Delgado’s new role is one SRS’ latest appointment, as the company has also recently announced that Charles “Chuck” Scherer – former SVP, ILS, at Aon Bermuda – joined SRS Bermuda as a Senior Vice President, insurance-linked securities (ILS).",

    text: "10x Banking has appointed Will Dale as its regional vice president in APAC.\n\nThe FinTech, founded by former Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins, raised a reported £40 million in fresh funding in January.\n\nThe appointment, which sees Dale join from Mambu – where he held the role of regional VP for nearly five years – sees 10x cement its presence in APAC as part of its mission to bring core banking transformation to financial institutions across the region.\n\nAdding to the firm’s existing operations in Sydney, Dale will lead 10x’s APAC growth strategy from Singapore, where the business plans to build an office base underpinned by continued sustainable growth, leveraging its expertise and track record of successful core bank transformation from long-term partnerships with the likes of Westpac and JP Morgan.\n\n“We see a tremendous opportunity in APAC, with banks of all sizes wanting to expand and grow their product lines but finding themselves held back by the legacy technology they operate on,” said Matt Mills, CRO of 10x.\n\n“Through Will’s appointment, we have someone on the ground who can help banks realise the full potential of core transformation but more importantly the rapid product development it unlocks.”\n\nDale’s time at Mambu, preceded by more than 12 years at Fiserv, sees him join 10x on the back of over 17 years’ experience working with APAC banks to transform the way they operate and serve their customers.\n\nDale said: “10x’s ability to not only bring core transformation to banks but to do it in a way that works with a bank’s existing development teams and infrastructure within their own cloud environment is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n“Singapore is an obvious strategic hub for us to operate from, firstly because we can support banks in region who are already on that innovation journey but feel encumbered by the technology they are building on.\n\n“Secondly, because several countries across APAC are scaling their banking operations at unprecedented speeds. Banks need the deployment flexibility and platform extensibility that 10x brings, underpinned by tier 1 bank grade security architecture, to support their new and existing customers with innovative digital products.”\n\nHe added: “From a risk management perspective, APAC banks need a solution to adapt quickly to regulatory changes without working directly on legacy technology, and this is where 10x can help; enabling a more robust, resilient strategy for banks in the region.”",

This is the first delivery of a committed backlog of 76 A321neo aircraft.

      "Snowflake Continues APAC Expansion Through Globe Telecom Collaboration",
    text: "Snowflake, a cloud-native data company, has made its official debut in the Philippines through a collaboration with Globe Telecom, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. Globe Telecom will utilize the vendor to improve data-driven decision making through data democratization.\n\nAccording to Dan Natindim, vice president of Enterprise Data Office at Globe Telecom, Data democratization is data at your fingertips — the ability to independently access, use, and explore data.\n\nData democratization refers to the process through which information in a digital format is made available to the average end user. Data democratization aims to make data collection and analysis accessible to non-specialists who don’t need outside assistance.\n\nConsequently, they want as many job functions as possible to be able to make data-driven decisions in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of help from others.\n\nGlobe needed a more “scalable, cost-effective, and unified platform” that would improve data accessibility and foster employee collaboration in order to better respond to the expanding digital demands of Filipinos.\n\nAccording to Sanjay Deshmukh, Senior Regional Vice President, ASEAN and India, at Snowflake, Globe chose Snowflake specifically to assist them in making use of its vast data repository and accelerating its internal transformation journey. The goal of the Snowflake-Globe collaboration is to democratize data and enable data-driven decision-making, which is essential for a telco that gathers a mass of data on a regular basis.\n\nThe Filipino telco launched a data modernization effort through its Enterprise Data Office to take advantage of the cloud’s “high performance, robustness, and speed,” which it deemed as “important” in providing quick answers to its customers.\n\nGlobe moved its enterprise data office from on-premises to Snowflake’s Data Cloud in 53 days with the help of the vendor’s Professional Services Team, gaining “near-unlimited and highly scalable” storage and compute capabilities as well as “near real-time” data insights.\n\nAt the same time, the cloud-native platform from Snowflake is stated to have helped Globe move to a public cloud architecture, which has led to a “50% increase in annual cost savings.”\n\nDeshmukh emphasized the necessity for modern data platforms for businesses looking to tackle data-related business problems, and Globe has obtained one by working with them.\n\nMoreover, with the Globe collaboration, Snowflake entered the Filipino market as part of its Southeast Asian client expansion strategy.",

To help Havas Health & You (HH&Y) meet the needs of this exponential growth and of the global brands across their portfolio of clients, the network today announced the expansion of its Southeast Asia (SEA) Village, bringing the unique business model to bolster capabilities in the region.

The network is the market leader in China and Japan and is continuing to recruit in India, Singapore, and the Philippines to expand capabilities across these markets.\n\n\"Continued growth in the region means that the health world must unquestionably stay attuned to this growing pool of talent, incredible innovation and expansive population,\" said Charles Houdoux, CEO APAC & LATAM, HH&Y. \"Our unmatched expertise here offers brands both locally and globally tremendous opportunity, and with the partnership of Vivendi, Havas and our broader network, we are poised to continue to lead as we double down on our capabilities in digital transformation, multichannel engagement through data, content and much more.\"\n\nAbout Havas Health & You\n\nHavas Health & You unites Havas Life, Health4Brands (H4B), Lynx, Red Havas and Havas Health Plus, all wholly owned health and communications networks, with the consumer health businesses and practices of Havas Creative Group.

    text: 'Gap Inc has earmarked US$700m worth of CAPEX investments for 2022, with supply chain transformation a key area of focus as it looks to drive efficiencies and eliminate waste.\n\nOn an analyst call in the wake of its fourth quarter results, which saw Gap Inc swing to a US$16m net loss, CEO Sonia Syngal said investments would be largely slated against supply chain and technology projects focused on driving automation, speed and efficiency within the fulfillment network, along with enhanced digital loyalty and personalisation capabilities across the portfolio.\n\nDuring 2021, Syngal said Gap Inc faced headwinds with supply chain issues weighing heavily on performance as a result of longer transit times from the West Coast port delays and sudden and prolonged closure of factories in Vietnam.\n\nQ4 net sales of $4.53bn were up 2% from $4.42bn in the prior-year period. Comparable sales were up 3% year-over-year.\n\nNet loss amounted to $16m, compared to net income of $234m a year earlier.\n\nFY net sales of $16.67bn increased 21% year-over-year from $16.38bn last time. Comparable sales were up 6% year-over-year.\n\nNet income amounted to $256m, compared to a net loss of $665m in the prior year.\n\nGap inc expects fiscal year 2022 revenue growth to be in the low single-digit range versus fiscal year 2021 with first quarter net sales expected to be down mid to high-single digits versus the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIn the near term, Gap Inc is diversifying port exposure. Beginning with its summer assortment, it is moving the vast majority of products through Eastern and Southern ports, “where delays are materially better than on the West Coast,” Syngal explained.\n\nGap Inc also plans to optimise manufacturing, including proximate sourcing to enable flexibility and increase speed.\n\n“Specifically, we are growing our Mexico and Central America sourcing in 2022,” Syngal asserted, adding that over the longer term Gap Inc is looking at “de-risking” its supply chain “by rebalancing sourcing to rely less on single countries of origin and building deeper relationships with near-shore vendors”.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

      "Spring in its step: New Zealand sheep milk firm reveals APAC expansion plans for infant and toddler formula",
    text: "The firm will next turn its attention to its home market and China, followed by other Asian nations, and then Australia next year. The product is for toddlers aged one to three.\n\nIn an interview with NutraIngredients-Asia​, CEO Scottie Chapman explained why the firm decided to first launch the product in Malaysia. “We wanted to enter a market in Asia that is representative of all the Asian markets, and we found Malaysia to be a sophisticated market.”​\n\nThe company plans to launch its toddler formula in New Zealand within the year, which will be available in mother and baby stores, supermarkets and pharmacies.\n\nIt is expanding into China later this year through cross-border e-commerce platform Tmall, and other Asian countries in sight include Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Singapore.\n\nThe company is also working on launching its stage 1 and 2 infant formulas in Asia, adding more distribution across both online and offline channels.\n\nIt also produces full cream sheep milk powder for adults and children above four, as well as sheep milk calcium tablets (containing probiotics, vitamin D3, and DHA).\n\nThe milk powder was launched in New Zealand and Taiwan in 2016, and the tablets hit the Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia markets in 2017.\n\nBenefits​\n\nThe company uses New Zealand grass-fed sheep milk from its flock of 10,000 sheep across farms in the Central North Island, however this season, only 6,500 will be milked. The milk is then spray-dried into powder at Food & Innovation Waikato, and used in its tablets, powder, and formula ranges.\n\nChapman added that its products contained no added sucrose, growth hormones and were non-GMO.\n\nHe said sheep milk contain all the essential amino acids, was easily digestible for children, and gentle on the stomach.\n\nIn addition, sheep milk naturally contains only A2-type protein only, not A1 that is found in cow’s milk. The latter can cause digestive discomfort for some people.\n\nCOVID-19 impact​\n\nChapman told us demand for its sheep milk dairy products had been stronger since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with China’s government backing the consumption of dairy for immune health​.\n\nThe Chinese government and four major dairy industry associations formed a set of guidelines indicating that milk and other dairy products were an excellent source of high-quality protein, vitamins A, B2, calcium and other nutrients.\n\nIt stated in a formal statement: “A higher intake of these products for those low in protein, especially when higher immune resistance is required to fight the novel coronavirus, will be very beneficial​.”\n\nThey advised a daily intake of 300g of liquid milk or equivalent dairy products.\n\n“Based on the Chinese government’s advice that dairy will boost the immune system, and help fight COVID-19, we have seen demand for our products rise considerably​,” Chapman said.",

      "Rich pickings: Swiss caviar supplement set for APAC expansion after success in Philippines and Thailand",
    text: "The company is planning to release the product, also named, Caviarlieri in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam, before targeting Australia.\n\nCaviarlieri was first launched in its home market, Switzerland, before entering the Philippines in July last year, and Thailand in February this year. The product is manufactured in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Shane Wang, marketing director at Caviarlieri Limited, the firm is currently appointing a distributor and acquiring approvals from the regulatory authorities in the respective countries.\n\nCaviarlieri is distributed at pharmacies, anti-ageing clinics, aesthetic clinics, as well as clinics specialising in cardiology.\n\nDiverse benefits​\n\nThe company claims Caviarlieri works on multiple levels with benefits including better energy levels, improved skin health, better sleep quality, and reduced joint pain.\n\nAccording to Wang, the caviar used in Caviarlieri is obtained from the sturgeon, and contains amino acids and essential fatty acids (EPA, DHA).\n\nWang told NutraIngredients-Asia​: “The known beneficial properties of essential fatty acids are extensive like ensuring proper functioning of the cells, supporting brain health, ensuring regulation of the inflammatory responses, reduction of joint pain and prevention of photo skin ageing​.”\n\nCaviarlier also contains other bioactive ingredients such as marine protein peptides (DNA extracts from wild salmon and haddock), marine collagen, coenzyme Q10 and selenium.\n\n“The synergistic formulation of these ingredients help mood elevation, reduction in joint pain, increase in energy levels, improvement in skin complexion, mental concentration and delay the onset and progression of age related diseases​,” Wang added.\n\nIn one study by R. Catanzaro et al​​., patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomised into a double-blind study, group A (Caviarlieri) and group B (glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate). Osteoarthritis is a slow, chronic joint disease that causes pain and physical disability, and participants were given painkillers on demand. Group A participants reported a quicker and higher degree of improvement and lower painkiller use at the end of 18 weeks.\n\nIn another study by DH Chui et al​​., on mental health, stressed but otherwise healthy participants were divided in two groups (Caviarlieri or placebo). After two months of supplementation, stressed participants had a significantly lower level of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor).\n\nOne study on skin ageing by F Marotta et al​​., found that Caviarlieri-treated skin had significantly more synthesis of collagen type I after 72 hours. Abnormalities in collagen is what causes physiological ageing of the skin and reduction of skin thickness.\n\nWang said besides being an anti-ageing supplement, Caviarlieri claims to have immune boosting functions too.\n\nOne of the active ingredients in Caviarlieri is selenium, which in the right dosages is a potent antioxidant that keeps the immune system in check by reducing oxidative stress in the body, and identifying and warding off potentially harmful threats, like viruses, parasites and bacteria.\n\nWang told us: “By providing essential nutrition at the cellular level, Caviarlieri can accelerate cellular renewal and repair via protein synthesis against damaged or dysfunctional immune cells which can potentially help to strengthen our immune system against viruses and diseases. This has to be a consistent approach to better immune health especially if one is suffering from chronic ailments​.”\n\nDelivery technology​\n\nCaviarlieri is available in a soft-gel format, and contains 50mcg of selenium. Wang recommends one to two soft gels daily, taken 20 minutes before breakfast.\n\nWang stressed that the manufacturing process was important in delivering the nutrients efficiently.\n\n“The digestive tract of most people after 30 will start to deteriorate and effective absorption therefore will be an issue​.”\n\nWang said Caviarlieri was manufactured using its proprietary Swiss Cold extraction technology called Cellularix, which ensures that the chemical integrity of the inherent micronutrients are not compromised in the production process.\n\nIn addition, the caviar and marine peptides in Caviarlieri also help to escort the micronutrients to the cells for optimal absorption.\n\n“We believe that if the inherent ingredients of the product have strong antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties and the manufacturing technology ensures that the biochemical integrity of the product is not compromised, then absorption can be optimised and the results will be prominent​.”\n\nWang said the company was intending to launch a complementary skin care product at the end of this year.",

    text: 'Boyle, who has run APAC since 2016, becomes chief executive of Publicis Media EMEA and APAC in his expanded role.\n\nNicole Pruesse, who has been chief operating officer of EMEA since 2016, takes a similar expanded role as chief operating officer of Publicis Media EMEA and APAC.\n\nBoyle, who is Scottish, and Pruesse, who is German, will be in charge of all of Publicis Media’s global operations outside the Americas.\n\nPublicis Media said a "unified leadership structure" across EMEA and APAC will help in "simplifying" the business and improving "service" for clients.\n\nBoyle and Pruesse are both veterans of Zenith Optimedia – like Steve King, the global chief executive of Publicis Media, and Tim Jones, the chief executive of Publicis Media Americas.\n\nKing broke up Zenith Optimedia and sister unit Starcom Mediavest Group into four agencies in a single operating unit, Publicis Media, in 2016 as part of a group-wide restructuring.\n\n"This is a further step in strengthening and simplifying Publicis Media," King said, referring to the decision to merge the leadership of EMEA and APAC two years after first setting up the operating company.\n\n"Simplicity of management is the attraction. It just makes it easier for EMEA and APAC to be under one leadership."\n\nBoyle, who is based in Singapore, will split his time between Asia and Europe until the end of the year when he will move back to the UK.\n\nKing said: "Gerry is a proven and well-known leader, strategist and client partner."\n\nBoyle assumes the responsibilities previously held by Iain Jacob, who has stepped down as chief executive of EMEA.\n\nKing said he has tried to promote an even balance of executives from Zenith Optimedia and SMG in Publicis Media - just as he did when he merged Zenith and Optimedia a decade and a half ago.\n\nHe pointed out that agency CEO roles are not the only important positions within Publicis Media and client leadership jobs carry increasing weight.\n\n"We\'re clearly moving to a world where it\'s about client-centric solutions and they\'re going to be delivered through agency brands," he said.\n\nPublicis Media, which includes Blue 449, Performics, Spark Foundry, Starcom and Zenith, is marking its second anniversary .\n\nIt has expanded from around 18,000 to 24,000 staff over the period, partly through the addition of Digitas.\n\n"Having one P&L in each market is probably the best thing we did because the agencies work together, instead of competing," King said.\n\nPublicis Groupe needs to cut costs after promising shareholders at its investor day in London in March that it would improve operating margin by 0.3% to 0.5% per year between 2018 and 2020.',

    text: "Rostro Financials Group has announced that following last year’s acquisition of Retail FX broker Scope Markets, the change of control process has now been completed.\n\nAs a result, the Rostro Group management team has from 7 January 2023 assumed control of the combined businesses, inclusive of licensed entities in Cyprus, Kenya, South Africa, and Belize, alongside the main operating hub based in Cyprus. The newly acquired licenses complement those held in Mauritius and Seychelles.\n\nThe new ownership group said that Scope Markets is additionally evaluating further expansion into MENA and the wider Asian regions in 2023, and has engaged 3rd parties to progress these strategic initiatives.\n\nRostro Group added that it intends to continue with the organic growth of the enlarged business and remains open to further acquisitions to help meet the stated corporate vision of being the world’s #1 diversified financial services group, servicing retail and institutional customers across the globe.\n\nRostro Financial was founded in 2020 by former ACM/TradeTech (now Finalto) executive Roger Hambury, with ambitions to acquire and grow out companies in the Retail FX, CFDs, and crypto trading sector. The company announced its first acquisition in early 2022 buying CySEC-licensed Scope Markets, and has since added a number of (mainly) FX industry executives including John Williams (ex Equiti Capital) as CIO, former Equiti Capital COO Michael Ayres as CEO, Equiti and GKFX alum Mitesh Vaghela as CPO, and Equiti exec Owen Purssell as Head of Distribution.\n\nRostro Group CEO Michael Ayres said,\n\n“We are delighted to have now completed the change of control process, bringing Scope Markets under the Rostro Group umbrella.

    title: "OVHcloud expands in APAC with the first data centre in India",
    text: "OVHcloud, the European cloud data centre provider, has launched its first data centre in India as part of its Asia Pacific (APAC) expansion plans. In addition, the company will see the deployment of two additional data centres in Australia and Singapore by next year.\n\nAdding to OVHcloud’s network of data centres worldwide, the new Mumbai facility is part of its recently announced global strategic plan to build 15 new sites by 2024. The global expansion will provide OVHcloud customers with open, trusted, sovereign and sustainable cloud solutions that will enable them to meet growing digital needs.\n\nThe announcement comes at a crucial time for the Asia Pacific region, which has witnessed an uptick in cloud adoption amidst sharper regulatory scrutiny over data sovereignty and environmental concerns.\n\nFor India, cloud-enabled digital transformation is driving the explosive growth of the national digital economy, which already outpaces the growth of the larger economy by 2.4 times. Additionally, under the Digital India government campaign underpinning a concerted push for digital transformation on a national scale, business and government sectors are both set to increase their reliance on the cloud.\n\n“Since the expansion of our presence in the Asia Pacific market, the region has experienced phenomenal growth of its digital economy. India, Australia and Singapore remain critical markets that are driving this growth from a business transformation and digital innovation perspective,” says Michel Paulin, Chief Executive Officer, OVHcloud.\n\n“Data sovereignty and sustainability will continue to be key priorities that have to be balanced with rapidly increasing digital needs. We are confident that new data centres will further help OVHcloud’s goal of becoming the cloud provider of choice for customers in the region, in enabling them to remain compliant while benefiting from our unique proposition of an open, reversible and sustainable cloud.”\n\nOVHcloud's new data centre in Mumbai will offer Indian businesses enhanced support through local computing and storage capabilities to meet evolving data compliance needs, especially as the Indian Government pushes for more comprehensive data protection laws to go along with a growing digital economy.\n\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, National Data Governance Framework policy, and IT Rules, introduced in the last two years, collectively aim to balance data governance efforts with unlocking data-enabled innovation to spur further growth of the Indian digital economy.\n\nLaunching the new facility is also timely, particularly as India takes the presidency of G20 with a mandate of \"data for development\". India has set up a new Trade and Technology Council with the European Union to lead on digital transformation, green technologies and trade and implement data regulations such as the recently released Digital Personal Data Protection Bill.\n\nWith these policies in place, data residency in India remains a critical compliance criterion for businesses within the financial services and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\nAs a pioneer in sustainable cloud, OVHcloud has been deploying 20 years of industrial innovation, such as circularity and water cooling at scale. These disruptive innovations enable the company to reach best-in-class sustainability metrics, with a PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) at 1.28 and a WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness) of 0.26.\n\nBy manufacturing its servers, OVHcloud's integrated industrial model enables a sustainable cloud by design, with a Carbon Usage Effectiveness of 0.2. Furthermore, benefiting from OVHcloud's proprietary water cooling technology, this new data centre pushes the Group's technological and industrial expertise further by adapting its infrastructure to meet tropical conditions.\n\n“Already one of our top-performing markets in the APAC region, India continues to demonstrate remarkable potential for business growth. The strategic deployment of our first data centre in India is a firm testimony to that potential, and an affirmation of our commitment to customers and partners here,” says Terry Maiolo, Vice President and General Manager, APAC, OVHcloud.\n\n“Our new generation of data centres, coupled with enhanced compute and scalable storage capabilities, will elevate our ability to provide customers in India and the region with high-performance cloud solutions that have optimised and predictable price-performance ratios, even as their needs evolve.”\n\nThe expansion leverages OVHcloud's existing presence in India through the Mumbai Point of Presence, which opened in 2020 and minimised latency between India and Europe. In addition, with the newly launched data centre, local customers will enjoy close to instant access to their data and cloud resources while meeting increasingly stringent data compliance regulations.",

Already established in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Singapore; Thailand becomes the latest country to gain access to it.\n\nThousands of companies in Thailand have already signed up on Stripe during a beta phase over the past year.\n\nThey include the online property platform Baania, luxury furniture retailer Chanintr, holiday resort Coconut Beach Bungalows, accounting software platform FlowAccount, and digital creator platform Storior.\n\nThai companies now have full access to Stripe solutions like Billing for subscriptions and recurring payments, Checkout and Payment Links for e-commerce, Invoicing for automated payment collection and reconciliation, Radar for fraud detection and prevention, Connect for software platforms and marketplaces, and more.\n\nThai businesses will be able to accept payments via major credit cards like Visa and Mastercard, as well as through PromptPay, a Thailand-based payment method that uses unique identifiers such as a phone number, citizen ID, or QR code to allow customers to make payments using their preferred apps.\n\nStripe collaborated closely with the Bank of Thailand as it prepared to roll out payment services support for Thai businesses.\n\n“Thailand’s digital economy is one of the fastest growing in Southeast Asia.

      "Revolut Expands Into LatAm on Mission To Increase Financial Inclusion",
    text: "2023 has been an eventful year for Revolut, the global financial super app. Having launched its app in New Zealand and Brazil, the organisation is consequently available in 41 markets. But it is not stopping there. Due to the growth of digital adoption in the rest of Latin America (LatAm), Revolut is planning its next steps for expansion into the region.\n\nAccording to Statista, the transaction value of digital commerce in LatAm was estimated at more than $100billion in 2019. Based on current growth, it is expected to increase by approximately 73 per cent by 2025. As a result, Revolut is looking to capitalise on the growing LatAm market, providing new customers with offers such as free transfers.\n\nOffering the unbanked populace of LatAm, which was estimated to be around 122 million people in 2021 according to the World Bank, a digital solution, Revolut aims to bolster financial inclusion with its Lite app. It enables consumers to send transfers to another Revolut customer for free via Revolut’s P2P system, card transfer and international bank transfers. While already up and running in LatAm countries, namely Brazil Chile, the company wants to expand into Ecuador and Argentina. Furthermore, Revolut’s Lite app is also live:\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nQatar\n\nSri Lanka\n\nMoldova\n\nVietnam\n\nBangladesh\n\nArmenia\n\nMacao\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nExisting customers in Chile have already transferred more than £1.2million with an average transaction amount (sending and receiving) of £800. Furthermore, 90 per cent of the customers are able to receive money within 24 hours.\n\nImportance for expat communities\n\nThe expansion into LatAm is increasingly valuable to the three million Revolut expat customers in Spain and Portugal, who look to send money back to their families. Of the top 20 expat communities in Spain, eight are from LatAm countries. In Spain, according to the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, more than 880.000 immigrants from Latam countries send money to their home countries at least once a year.\n\nFor Portugal, almost 800.000 expats live in the country. Thirty per cent are Brazilian, according to data from Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF). For these communities, the launch of Revolut in Brazil gives them the opportunity to send money to their country of origin in a fast, simple and affordable manner.\n\nBuilding a financially inclusive world\n\nRevolut isn’t only targeting emerging markets. In its mission to create financial inclusion for all, Revolut is also focusing on developed markets, like the US. It is offering accounts to non-US citizens lawfully in the US, who do not have an SSN/ITIN.\n\nThere are more than 2.5 million people in the US on some sort of visa and who do not have a SSN or ITIN; of which 1 million are students. This population is generally ignored by financial institutions. As a result, they do not have access to cost-effective financial services; they are left with limited options for managing their finances.\n\nA clear example of the value of this service is the large remittance corridor that exists between the US and Mexico with more than $60billion a year. Revolut users in the US can greatly benefit from Revolut’s services to send and receive money to and from the neighboring country. Therefore, Mexico is also one of the most important and upcoming targets on Revolut’s international expansion list.",

    text: "Transak, the leading Web3 payments and onboarding solution, announces its strategic expansion into the Asia Pacific (APAC) region with the establishment of an official entity in Hong Kong. Following a successful Series-A funding round mid-2023, led by prominent investors including Animoca Brands, Transak aims to leverage Hong Kong's unique position as a global financial hub and gateway to the APAC market.\n\nThis expansion is set to facilitate better access to alternative financial markets across the region, supported by Hong Kong’s forward-thinking regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Transak plans to enhance local engagement by supporting commonly-used payment methods and integrating with Hong Kong’s Faster Payment Network, aligning with its mission to simplify Web3 accessibility.\n\nTransak is dedicated to reducing the high barrier to entry typical of today's Web3 applications. By simplifying the complexities of crypto transactions, public key cryptography, and smart contracts, Transak's Hong Kong-based entity aims to significantly boost Web3 service adoption across APAC. The company's commitment extends to full compliance with Hong Kong’s regulatory standards, ensuring a smooth and compliant operation.\n\nA testament to its commitment to regulatory excellence, Transak operates across 150+ countries, adhering to an extensive array of regulatory compliances. Notably, Transak was among the first global on/off-ramps to secure an FCA license in the UK in early 2022. By mid-2023, Transak achieved FIU compliance in India and is registered as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in Poland, EU. In the US, Transak is registered as a Money Services Business (MSB) with FinCEN, underscoring its global compliance and operational standards.\n\nRecognizing the complexities of local regulatory compliance, Transak is set to hire a team of local directors and experts in Hong Kong. This initiative will ensure adherence to all local regulations, facilitating active engagement with policymakers and regulatory authorities to shape the future of digital assets in the region.\n\n“Transak sees Hong Kong as an ideal base to launch its operations and propel growth in the APAC region’s dynamic and innovative Web3 economy,” said Transak General Manager of APAC, Maximilian von Hulewicz, in a statement. “Hong Kong is a renowned global financial hub and stands as the gateway to the greater APAC region, boasting one of the world’s most crypto-friendly regulatory regimes. By establishing our base here, Transak is ideally poised to help drive the expansion and adoption of its compliant and user-friendly crypto onboarding services and help usher in the next generation of Web3 enthusiasts.”\n\nTransak's efforts to capitalise on Hong Kong’s strategic APAC position and positive digital asset outlook include key collaborations with local fintech companies and institutions. The company has already gotten the ball rolling in that regard, recently signing on as a member of Web3 Harbour – one of Hong Kong’s leading Web3 communities and ecosystem builders that champions cross-sector industry collaboration – to accelerate the development and adoption of blockchain technologies and the decentralised internet.\n\n\"We are thrilled to see Transak expanding into Hong Kong and we are delighted to count it as one of Web3 Harbour’s newest members. This marks a positive milestone in the growth of the digital asset ecosystem in the APAC region,” commented Gary Liu, Chairman, Web3 Harbour.\n\nTransak’s expansion to Hong Kong is also supported by Animoca Brands, which participated in the Series-A funding announced by Transak in May 2023. Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, said in a statement, “We’re delighted by Transak’s strategic expansion into Hong Kong, establishing the city as its gateway to the Asia-Pacific region. Having already backed Transak in its Series A funding last year, we’re thrilled to support its endeavor to facilitate seamless user onboarding for potentially over a billion users in Asia as the company seeks to replicate its success from the US, Europe, and beyond.”\n\nAbout Transak\n\nTransak (https://transak.com) is a global Web3 payment and onboarding infrastructure provider, facilitating seamless transitions between traditional finance and crypto assets. Web3 platforms using Transak can embed the best way to onboard users by enabling them to buy or sell crypto assets from 150+ countries, as Transak abstracts away the complexity of user KYC, risk monitoring, compliance, payment methods and customer support.\n\nTransak’s product suite includes robust fiat-to-crypto services (on/off-Ramps), a fiat-to-smart-contract solution (Transak One), and a fiat-to-NFT checkout solution. As a regulated, non-custodial payments layer, Transak supports onboarding to 160+ crypto assets across 75+ blockchains. Trusted by over 350 applications, including MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet, Transak makes Web3 applications more accessible.",

    text: "Vantage FX, the multi-asset broker, is leveraging its APAC-adjacent headquarters and emerging markets expertise to further increase its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nFinance Magnates spoke with T. Chang, Regional Business Director for the Asia-Pacific at Vantage FX, to explore what this move means for the business and the region’s markets.\n\nLet’s start with the basics. What is Vantage FX and what’s your current positioning in the Asia-Pacific landscape?\n\nVantage FX is a global business headquartered in Sydney, Australia. Although our origins are in FX, we’re a multi-asset broker with more than 300 instruments.\n\nAs a brokerage, our goal is pure and simple: to provide a best-in-class Trading Platform Trading Platform In the FX space, a currency trading platform is a software provided by brokers to their respective client base, garnering access as traders in the broader market. Most commonly, this reflects an online interface or mobile app, complete with tools for order processing.Every broker needs one or more trading platforms to accommodate the needs of different clients. Being the backbone of the company’s offering, a trading platform provides clients with quotes, a selection of instruments to trade, real In the FX space, a currency trading platform is a software provided by brokers to their respective client base, garnering access as traders in the broader market. Most commonly, this reflects an online interface or mobile app, complete with tools for order processing.Every broker needs one or more trading platforms to accommodate the needs of different clients. Being the backbone of the company’s offering, a trading platform provides clients with quotes, a selection of instruments to trade, real Read this Term to our clients.\n\nWe also develop targeted tools for local Introducing Brokers to enable best execution. While we do provide clients with objective educational resources where needed, we don’t advise on trading strategy, or give directions for them to trade.\n\nIt’s one of our foundational missions to open up equal investment opportunities to those who may have previously not had access.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) is a prime example of an extremely promising market which has historically been overlooked and underserved in terms of the financial services available to them.\n\nFor this reason, it was one of the first regions in which we made a real name for ourselves.\n\nOur location and historic expertise in emerging markets helped us to make positive traction early on, and about 20-30% of our whole business is now based in the region.\n\nWhat’s your role at the company? Why were you drawn to being Business Director for this region in particular?\n\nAs the Regional Business Director for the Asia-Pacific, I’m constantly thinking about and planning for future business inroads.\n\nMy philosophy – and one of the main reasons I was drawn to Vantage FX – is that you should never enter a new market with the purpose of seeking profit out of it until it’s depleted.\n\nWe want to build up an ecosystem in the Asia-Pacific that is just as fruitful for our clients and partners as it is for us. It’s for this reason that, while lots of brokerages are looking for short-term profit, Vantage FX is investing long-term in the future of emerging markets like APAC.\n\nOver the last two to three years, we’ve been really honing in on the exciting new generation of brokers and investors in Southeast Asia. We are also looking towards expansion in East and Central Asia.\n\nWhy the focus on the Asia-Pacific, and Southeast Asia more specifically, as a region for expansion?\n\nTraders in the Asia-Pacific are young and hungry. There is a new generation coming through that is wealthier and more business-savvy than their predecessors and the earning potential is high, with more high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) meaning more people looking for investment opportunities.\n\nAt the same time, there is a lack of awareness around what best execution looks like – something which scammers have been quick to exploit.\n\nWe saw that the existing brokerage landscape wasn’t serving local needs; while there a bunch of smaller local brokerages and a handful of internationals, they rarely have local teams or provide local language services.\n\nWe knew we had to get on the ground early on to make a name for ourselves and build trust with both clients and partners. So, the opportunity for us here was very different to, say, Europe; there are a lot of historic brokerages over there, and Europeans like history.\n\nWhile we’ve got a solid, loyal client base there, competition is tighter.\n\nWe’re focused more specifically on Southeast Asia because, at this moment in time, the FX market is more developed over there compared to the wider Asia-Pacific, as is our presence.\n\nAnd why should Asia-Pacific want you? What makes Vantage FX different from other trading platforms?\n\nVantage FX is at the cutting edge of trading. At a global level, our offering is competitive in terms of spread, and the range of products and tools we provide our clients and introducing brokers.\n\nYou can see this in our multitude of management tools, proprietary mobile app, and the fact that we are continuously improving different local payment options and supports.\n\nWe’ve found our mobile-friendly tools to be particularly attractive in emerging markets where many clients have leapfrogged legacy technology straight to mobile phones.\n\nThe pandemic has also accelerated the uptake of mobile trading.\n\nThe fact that Vantage FX is a licensed brokerage in the Asia-Pacific also sets us apart from many in the region, reassuring clients that their funds are safe with us.\n\nOn top of that, as a professional trading platform, we are always trying to provide the best possible trading environment for our clients, which is essential for traders in the region, many of whom aren’t historically familiar with brokerages and don’t know what to look out for in terms of best execution.\n\nWe also have a lot of value to add from a compliance perspective, having operated in a number of different regulatory environments. We have a historic understanding of local markets which enables us to anticipate potential compliance challenges.\n\nThis will be increasingly essential for our APAC clients as the region’s markets evolve and pursue greater Regulation Regulation Like any other industry with a high net worth, the financial services industry is tightly regulated to help curb illicit behavior and manipulation. Each asset class has its own set of protocols put in place to combat their respective forms of abuse.In the foreign exchange space, regulation is assumed by authorities in multiple jurisdictions, though ultimately lacking a binding international order. Who are the Industry’s Leading Regulators?Regulators such as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority ( Like any other industry with a high net worth, the financial services industry is tightly regulated to help curb illicit behavior and manipulation. Each asset class has its own set of protocols put in place to combat their respective forms of abuse.In the foreign exchange space, regulation is assumed by authorities in multiple jurisdictions, though ultimately lacking a binding international order. Who are the Industry’s Leading Regulators?Regulators such as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority ( Read this Term.\n\nComprehensive local language support is another thing that sets us apart from most other brokerages operating in APAC.\n\nWe have almost 100 people on-the-ground in different regions, including a local country manager, local business team, and local marketing team, all dedicated to providing tailored guidance in our clients’ preferred local languages.\n\nAdditionally, we provide customised promotion for different regions, on top of standardised promotion, to make it easier for our Introducing Brokers to get in front of clients. That gets them a foot in the door so clients can see just how good our offering is.\n\nWhat is the process like for tailoring your offering to meet local needs, especially in such a diverse and expansive market as the Asia-Pacific?\n\nWe’ve done extensive research into what traders in different Asia-Pacific markets value. As you rightly point out, trading strategies, styles and requests differ greatly country-to-country.\n\nWe pride ourselves on listening and responding to partners as flexibly and effectively as we can. There are lots of new traders entering the market and we want to be a valuable source of information, educating our clients at all levels and making their lives as straightforward as possible.\n\nUpon joining Vantage FX, each client is assigned a dedicated account manager, who is their ongoing point of contact and has access to the details of what the trader has been doing on the platform, providing a simple way to ask questions and troubleshoot any technical challenges.\n\nIn this way, our offering isn’t just tailored to local needs at a country level, but at an individual client level.\n\nWhat does the future look like for Vantage FX in the region?\n\nWe have a very sustainable business model that involves pushing into new markets and building the reach and quality of our brand name so that, when people are choosing a brokerage, or a way to invest, we are top of mind.\n\nAs one of the most developed FX markets in APAC, Southeast Asia is a useful pilot for us for further expansion in other APAC regions – namely East and Central Asia.\n\nWe’re also constantly developing new products and tools, with a focus on mobile, app-based integrations. For example, we are in the process of integrating with social trading platform Pelican Trading and improving chart functions by TradingView.\n\nThis will be especially important once the brand name is established, generating organic traffic which will see people driven to independently find us online. Converting sales from initial interest as quickly as possible as essential at this stage.\n\nWe want people to be able to be able to open an account with us in under a minute.",

    text: "GR8 Tech’s presence at ICE in London, with over 300 meetings held, marked a successful start to the business year, bringing the company several new clients and laying the groundwork for its expansion into the Latin American region.\n\n“While the latest ICE in London was not primarily focused on generating new leads, it proved to be an invaluable platform for reconnecting with industry peers and reigniting old conversations. GR8 Tech capitalised on this opportunity, finalising discussions with several operators and thus adding three new clients to our growing portfolio. We look forward to the start of this cooperation and delivering results for our client,” said Evgen Belousov, GR8 Tech CEO.\n\nThe GR8 success formula\n\nOver the course of three action-packed days, GR8 Tech’s stand drew crowds with its dynamic and engaging setup. Among the highlights was a Formula 1 race car equipped with a cutting-edge VR experience, capturing the essence of GR8 Tech’s ‘top pit crew’ mentality and illustrating the company’s commitment to excellence. This feature proved to be a magnet for visitors, gathering non-stop traffic throughout the course of the event with over 60 participants every day.\n\nAdding to the excitement, the GR8 Quiz was successfully held on the second day of the exhibition, gathering over 100 participants. The quiz concluded with one lucky quick thinker winning tickets to the F1 Dutch Grand Prix 2024.\n\nAll this happened against the backdrop of a GR8 exhibition centered around GR8 Tech’s high-performance Sportsbook platform, renowned for its unique margin management capabilities, reliability, and scalability. Denys Parkhomenko, GR8 Tech CPO and the key person behind the GR8 Tech platform shared his impressions from ICE, stating, “Along with other GR8 products, the platform attracted a lot of interest from operators and received excellent feedback after the demos. I’m excited to see that because it affirms GR8 Tech’s direction and strategy in the highly competitive iGaming market landscape.”\n\nGR8 trajectory: New hires and LatAm expansion plans\n\nIn a strategic move to broaden its global footprint, GR8 Tech is to expand its presence in the Latin American region. This initiative was highlighted by the introduction of Thomas Carvalhaes, a known Brazilian iGaming executive with over 12 years of experience, who has joined GR8 Tech as a Senior Business Development Manager. Carvalhaes’ expertise in the LatAm iGaming landscape is expected to play a pivotal role in the company’s growth strategy.\n\n“Thomas will lead GR8 Tech’s expansion into LatAm, an incredibly interesting region for us considering its explosive growth, bolstered by strong mobile Internet usage that feeds a high demand for streaming and esports along with traditional sports. With our deep market experience and a compelling product lineup, including our versatile high-performance GR8 Sportsbook tailored to local tastes and a robust casino offering for business monetisation, we are ready to offer operators in the region—and globally—reliable, predictable, and profitable solutions, fostering success in our lifetime partnerships,” highlighted Yevhen Krazhan, Head of Global Sales at GR8 Tech.\n\nLooking ahead, GR8 Tech is set to delve deeper into the Latin American market with its participation in the upcoming SBC Summit Rio from March 5-7, 2024. Thomas Carvalhaes will take the stage as both a speaker and a moderator, engaging in discussions on Affiliate Leaders and Localised Marketing Approaches. The team aims to leverage these opportunities to gain insights into local trends and challenges, further strengthening their position in the region.\n\nThe momentum will continue with GR8 Tech’s presence at SiGMA Americas in April, where the company plans to showcase its products and solutions tailored to meet the specific needs of local operators. With a clear vision for the future and a solid plan in place, GR8 Tech is poised to continue its trajectory of growth and success in the iGaming industry.\n\nThis content has been produced in collaboration with a partner organisation through our Global Visibility Programme.

    text: "While debating the signing of a new extradition treaty with Mexico, Colombia will seek to establish or modify such deals with six other countries, evidence that President Juan Manuel Santos’ government is willing to increase its use of the controversial legal tool.\n\nColombia’s justice minister Juan Carlos Esguerra announced that the government is negotiating changes in their extradition deals with France, Costa Rica, and Panama. The government is also seeking to modify its extradition deal with Argentina, which is still presumed to be in force, according to the Organization of American States (OAS).\n\nColombia is additionally pursuing new extradition deals with Russia and Paraguay, according to El Tiempo.\n\nAccording to the OAS, Colombia currently has signed extradition treaties with 15 countries, as well as the United States. However, not all of these treaties are in force.\n\nThe most recent high-profile extradition case from Colombia to the US is Dolly Cifuentes, the mistress of former president Alvaro Uribe’s deceased brother, pictured above.\n\nInSight Crime Analysis\n\nMany of the modifications in Colombia’s pre-existing extradition deals will likely involve changing procedures for how suspected or convicted criminals are handed over to the other country. But there already is some debate over whether these treaties will allow more justice to be done. Colombian Congress still hasn’t signed last year’s extradition deal with Mexico into law, with some opponents arguing that this would only increase impunity rates, due to corruption within Mexico’s judicial system.\n\nExtradition has long been a controversial legal tool in Colombia. There has been widespread concern that paramilitaries extradited to the US on drug trafficking charges were granted reduced sentences for sharing intelligence with US authorities, and thus avoided being charged for other crimes in Colombia. Colombia’s justice minister has described the sentences issued by US courts to the paramilitaries as “lax.”",

      "NetSuite pitches automation, eyes high-growth markets in APAC expansion",
    text: 'NetSuite is eyeing a wider Asia-Pacific footprint in "high-growth" markets and will look to do so by building up its partner ecosystem. The Oracle-owned cloud software vendor also hopes to win customers over with a "full suite" integrated platform that features automation and delivers beyond ERP functionalities.\n\nOrganisations in the last two years had been accelerating their digital transformation and figuring out how to operate in a hybrid work environment, said NetSuite\'s founder and executive vice president Evan Goldberg.\n\nAt the same time, they faced supply chain disruptions and had to look to new geographies to regain resilience, Goldberg said during a briefing with Asia-Pacific media at NetSuite\'s SuiteWorld conference in Las Vegas this week.\n\nAmidst the need to manage fluctuating costs from a volatile supply chain and support a hybrid workplace, companies had to ensure people had access to the same consistent data regardless of where they were, he said.\n\nNetSuite executives are touting the value of a "full suite" software platform that offers a unified view and efficient manageability across key business operations, including inventory management, manufacturing, customer support, sales, and workforce management. This also ensures more accurate data analytics and forecasting.\n\nAutomation, in particular, plays a crucial role in easing and speeding up business processes, according to Goldberg.\n\nNetSuite Accounts Payable (AP) Automation, for instance, simplifies and automates bill payment processes including data capture and payment and reconciliation.\n\nUnveiled at the conference this week, the new offering helped businesses streamline key processes that were slow, tedious, and error-prone, said Goldberg.\n\nWith the tool, NetSuite said organisations could decide when and how to pay vendors, giving them control over their cashflow.\n\nGoldberg believes automation will continue to play a key role as 5G and edge computing technologies extend service delivery and data access, particularly in operating environments of industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and retail.\n\nAsked how NetSuite tools would evolve to support these new requirements, he pointed to opportunities for the use of robotics in warehouses and factories and bringing automation earlier in the operational lifecycle. The creation of work orders, for instance, could automatically trigger production processes.\n\nSmall companies would be able to access such "end-to-end" automation, not just big manufacturers, he noted. "Automation is the name of the game," he said, adding that it would enable employees to be more productive and effective, focusing on processes that generated more value for the business as well as tasks that still needed human judgment.\n\nCoupled with artificial intelligence and analytics, automation would further help organisations manage rising costs and mitigate the effects of a volatile supply chain, he said. Automating more, eliminating errors and gaining efficiencies would be increasingly crucial as margins thinned, he added.\n\nPartners key to APAC growth\n\nThat NetSuite offers a full suite software platform that offers beyond a single ERP function is the key message it also wants Asia-Pacific customers to take away, according to NetSuite\'s Asia-Pacific vice president KK Pan.\n\n"There\'s a unified pla8tform we\'re operating with a single data source that can be easily shared throughout the organisation, functions, and processes," Pan said in an interview with ZDNET. "It\'s also about helping our customers scale as they grow."\n\nIn Asia-Pacific, he said NetSuite was seeing high growth in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, where there were growing communities of unicorns, high-growth young companies, private equity firms, and startups.\n\nMarkets such as Indonesia and the Philippines also had large local populations that were young, he noted, adding that India was another market the software vendor was looking o grow its presence.\n\nTo drive its expansion plans, Pan said NetSuite would focus on building its partner ecosystem and enabling them to better service these growth markets.\n\nChannel partners played an important role in developing localised functions, he noted.\n\nIndia, for instance, was a huge market that was significantly diversified. He said partners that could assist NetSuite in localisation and productization were especially in such markets.\n\nThe software vendor was "expediting" its frameworks for local partners to better sell, implement, support, and build applications on top of the NetSuite platforms, Pan said. He pointed to its SuiteCloud Developer Network (SDN), a tooling platform designed to enable its partners to build specific functions tailored for a customer\'s business requirements.\n\n"It\'s how we gain velocity and localisation in a country and vertical," he said, adding that the vendor had SDN partners in markets such as Japan and South Korea.\n\nApart from developing localised functionalities, partners also played a key role in providing support in markets where NetSuite did not have a direct presence, he noted.\n\nThe software vendor has operations in Singapore, Japan, China, the Philippines, and Australia and New Zealand. Customers outside of these markets in the region are serviced by its channel partners.\n\nApart from training and better enabling its partner ecosystem to support customers, NetSuite also is exploring plans to expand its operations in some markets.\n\nIndonesia, in particular, was a market the software vendor was "seriously" looking at and where it night put in more sales resources, he said.\n\nAsked how many partners NetSuite had in Asia-Pacific as well as its growth rate in the region, Pan declined to provide specifics, saying only that it currently had "hundreds" of partners. He said the region was seeing growth rates that were "on par" with the vendor\'s global numbers.\n\nNetSuite said its ERP cloud revenue clocked a year-on-year growth rate of 27% in its first quarter 2023, ended August 30 this year.\n\nIts customers in Asia-Pacific included PropertyGuru, Carousell, ShopBack, Ninja Van, Jollibee, and LalaMove.\n\nBased in Singapore, Eileen Yu reported for ZDNET from NetSuite SuiteWorld 2022 in Las Vegas, USA, on the invitation of Oracle NetSuite.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE',

    text: "Keep up to Date with Latin American VC, Startups News\n\nZuru Latam, a technology company specializing in insurance for the logistics sector with a presence in Peru and Mexico, announced the formation of its Advisory Board.\n\nThis group, composed of prominent experts, will play a crucial role in providing strategic guidance in various areas of the business to drive development and success in Latin America.\n\nAn Advisory Board, also known as a advisory committee, does not have legally binding power, but it plays a fundamental role in providing advice, expertise, and strategic direction to an organization.\n\nIts function is to offer ideas, recommendations, and support to facilitate informed decisions and effectively address challenges.\n\nThe members of this advisory board have been carefully selected for their ability to contribute to Zuru Latam’s expansion and growth objectives.\n\nAmong the experts who will be part of the Advisory Board are,\n\n–Manuel Almenara Ferreyros, an expert in Finance, Insurance, and Reinsurance, with solid experience at Swiss Re and as the Founder of Hello Zum.\n\n–Darío Luna Plá, Founding Partner of Akua Capital S.C., with experience in structuring the first Lloyd’s Syndicate in Mexico and creating super.mx, the first digital subscription agent in Mexico.\n\n–Roberto Ramón, an expert in USA Logistics and Cross-border Mexico-USA, currently Co-Founder and CEO at CLS Express, a company specialized in cross-border services and last-mile distribution in Texas.\n\nThese professionals, with outstanding backgrounds in their respective fields, will contribute their knowledge and perspectives to strengthen Zuru Latam’s strategic direction and contribute to the company’s continued growth in the region.\n\nZuru Latam Technology\n\nZuru Latam has created a digital platform using Genexus, a low-code driven by artificial intelligence.\n\nZuru’s technology is offered through two business divisions; one for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and another for logistics intermediaries (freight agencies, customs agencies, carriers).\n\nThe platform for SMEs is an ecommerce that allows the customer to quote and acquire cargo insurance policies in minutes (on-demand). Due to its connection with insurance companies, the platform can offer a competitive premium in the market, as it does not maintain the high operational expenses incurred when sales are made in a traditional manner.\n\nOn the other hand, its platform for logistics intermediaries allows this type of customer to distribute and sell insurance coverage to their entire client portfolio, enabling a new revenue stream for each policy sold.\n\nThus, the proposal is unique as it minimizes operational expenses and offers very competitive premiums, thanks to its direct connection with insurance companies, highlights Gianmarco Scarsi, CEO of the company.",

    text: "Revolut is offering Revolut Lite in Latin American countries to make cross-border transactions and transfers more accessible to the unbanked.\n\nRevolut Lite will provide users with free transfers as a taster of the online banking experience until 30th August. This is currently operational in Chile. The payments giant aims to further expand into the region with plans to set up in Argentina and Ecuador through Lite, having already launched in Brazil this May with a cryptocurrency platform. Revolut Lite is also live outside Latin America, in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Moldova, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Armenia, Macao, and Azerbaijan.\n\nCurrent users in Chile have transferred £1.2 million, with an average transaction amount of £800.\n\nThe company’s LATAM expansion will also support the large expat communities that use the app in Spain and Portugal to send money home. Revolut has nearly three million customers in Spain and Portugal, and both have significant South American expat communities that require remittance services, , a substantial opportunity for Revolut.\n\nIn addition to this, with an aim of helping those financially excluded in the US, Revolut has also announced that the company will offer accounts to lawful non-US citizens in the US without SSN/ITIN who often struggle to open accounts. This group is around two and a half million, and consists of people on a visa without a SSN/ITIN; one million of which are students.\n\nRevolut will be offering features such as a low fee currency exchange and international transfers, a global debit card, and early salary access.\n\nMoney transfers spike around international cultural celebrations, Revolut reported earlier this month, marking a 62% increase in money transfers to and from Muslim countries during Eid al-Adha.",

    title: "Starling Bank expands its BaaS platform to APAC",
    text: "UK-based Starling Bank is introducing its Engine banking-as-a-service platform in Asia-Pacific. An unnamed Asian bank has already signed up to use Engine in order to develop and launch SME accounts, building on Starling’s expertise in the business banking space.\n\nWith expanding trade opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, the number of SMEs (and the opportunity they represent) is also rising. SMEs are the backbone of the Asian economy, employing more than 50% of the workforce. This provides an opportunity to banks that can offer personalised services to such businesses, which is one of the gaps Starling’s Engine platform is targeting. Launched in March 2022, the platform helps banks develop products including checking and business accounts without needing to handle all the groundwork themselves.\n\nAs per GlobalData’s 2022 Financial Services Consumer Survey, most small business owners use their personal account as their primary business account in Asia-Pacific (71.5%). This is partly because incumbent banks have not historically built out enough dedicated features to warrant opening separate accounts.\n\nFor many SME owners, their personal and business lives are closely intertwined, making this approach seem like the logical option. Just 16% of respondents in Asia-Pacific indicate they use a separate SME account to manage their business in Asia-Pacific.\n\nIn contrast, Starling has won businesses over in the UK with compelling features carefully matched to the various stages of a company’s evolution. The strong growth of SMEs in Asia-Pacific provides banks with a strong opportunity despite the currently limited uptake of business accounts. Following Starling’s focus on differentiation and tailored services would be a smart move – one that could be fast-tracked by signing up to utilise the Engine platform.",

    text: "Aeromexico has announced its third new route in the past week with plans to launch a seasonal service between the Mexican vacation destination of Cancun and the city of São Paulo in Brazil.\n\nThe flag-carrier has offered service to Brazil for more than two decades, and this new route will increase the carrier’s total monthly seats between the countries by 43%.\n\nFlights will operate between Cancun (CUN) and São Paulo Guarulhos (GRU) from Dec. 15 through April 17, 2022. Service will be three times per week using Boeing 787 aircraft.\n\n“For the Mexican Caribbean, this flight represents the increase not only of international air connectivity but also the growth of one of our strategic markets: Brazil,” said Carlos Joaquin Gonzalez, the governor of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, home to Cancun.\n\n“The launch of this route will allow us to shorten the distance with South America, strengthening the tourist reactivation in which we have worked in a gradual and orderly manner.”\n\nIn a statement, Aeromexico added that its Brazilian services had shown “substantial growth” in the last few years, and one of the important factors of this has been the tourism offer of the state of Quintana Roo.\n\nThe SkyTeam alliance member currently provides daily service to GRU from Mexico City (MEX) on board 787-9s, offering almost 4,000 two-way weekly seats.\n\nData provided by OAG Schedules Analyser shows that LATAM Airlines Group serves the CUN-GRU market twice a week using 767-300 equipment. However, the schedule is only in place until Sept. 26.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, GOL Linhas Aereas also offered flights to Cancun from Brazil, operating from Brasilia (BSB). Although the route has been suspended since March 2020, service is scheduled to resume in November.\n\nThe planned launch of Aeromexico’s new connection to São Paulo comes just days after the carrier revealed it will open two new routes to Madrid (MAD) in December.\n\nFlights will be offered to the Spanish capital from both Guadalajara’s Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla International (GDL) and Monterrey (MTY). Service on each route will be 3X-weekly using 787s.\n\nIn addition, the airline has confirmed the expansion of a codeshare agreement with LATAM Airlines Group, adding 18 new destinations in Peru to its network. The deal sees Aeromexico’s AM code placed on domestic routes operated by LATAM to the likes of Arequipa, Chiclayo and Jauja. In turn, LATAM passengers will have access to more than 40 points in Mexico served by Aeromexico.\n\nPhoto credit: Rob Finlayson",

    title: "Old Mutual LatAm chief targets market expansion under new owners",
    text: "Old Mutual’s chief executive for Latin America, David Buenfil, is eyeing a foray into new markets after the unit’s sale to its new Chinese owners clears.\n\nIn March, the South African group said it had agreed to sell its Colombia and Mexico operations, as well as Uruguay-based wealth platform Aiva, to CMIG International as it sought to focus on its home continent. Buenfil expects the new shareholders will support his business’s expansion in Latin America, he told Citywire Americas.\n\n‘I think that opportunity is there, no doubt, and I feel that more with [CMIG] than with Old Mutual,’ Buenfil, who also oversees Old Mutual’s Asia business, said. ‘Therefore, I do feel that this opens a new line of sight for us because it could allow us to think about new regions, no doubt, or new countries.’\n\nThe deal is still pending regulatory approval, which Buenfil said he expected by the end of the year.\n\nThinking ahead, he sees opportunities in Peru and Brazil, adding that the firm would likely enter those countries through its insurance or asset management units. However, he is holding off on making any definitive expansion plans until the transition process to the new owner is complete.\n\n‘I think the size of the businesses [in Peru and Brazil] would justify it. We think that penetration of insurance in those countries is relatively low - life insurance, that is,’ he said.\n\nOverall, Buenfil said he thinks CMIG will seek to maintain the South African firm’s setup in Latin America and use it as its vehicle to expand in the region.\n\nThe new owners might seek more acquisitions if the deals make sense, he added, but any expansion moves would likely happen through Old Mutual.\n\nDespite the new ownership, Buenfil said he doesn’t expect any changes to be made changes to their current structure, including within the leadership and investment teams.\n\nHe added: ‘The reality is that was one of the motivating points for [Old Mutual’s] executive team because, at least until now, the indication is that there would be absolutely no changes. What they’re coming in for is to support our group and they trust the executive team that’s here,’ he said.\n\nThe one thing that’s set to change is the firm’s name in the region. Old Mutual entered Colombia and Mexico in 2006 when it acquired Swedish financial group Skandia, with that brand being phased out in 2008.\n\nCMIG has said it plans to reintroduce the name, and Buenfil added the expected the change could come into effect in mid-2019. He added that Aiva, the Uruguay firm, would keep its brand.\n\nIn 2016, analysts predicted Old Mutual would offload its Latin American business after the firm said it would split its operations to cut costs. Old Mutual reportedly sold the Latin American unit for $300 million.\n\nBuenfil said he’s happy with the decision to have reached a deal with CMIG.\n\n‘The shareholders change but, really, the team, the employees, the process, the systems, the products - everything stays, and what this gives us is a catapult to keep growing,’ Buenfil said.",

    title: "LATAM expands cargo fleet to 21 aircraft",
    text: "Care to share?\n\nLATAM will expand its cargo fleet to 21 aircraft. The South American company plans to grow its cargo division by ten Boeing 767s in 2023, a 90 percent increase, it said in a statement on May 18.\n\nIt is not a surprise to see LATAM take this chance to increase its presence in the cargo business. Cargo is one of the few things rolling at the moment for LATAM and many other airlines. In 2021’s first quarter, cargo revenues increased by 36.8 percent compared to one year ago, with revenues at $345.2 million.\n\nDuring this period, LATAM operated its fleet of eleven B767-300Fs to the maximum. It deployed them with more weekly frequencies, allowing its available tonnes per kilometer (ATK) to increase by 26 percent compared to pre-pandemic levels. Between January and March, LATAM carried nearly 30,000 tons of cargo throughout its route map.\n\nTherefore, there is a market ready to be taken. As Andrés Bianchi, LATAM Cargo CEO, said: “The decision to expand our fleet is based on the attractive growth opportunities available, recent efficiency improvements, and flexibility that the B767F freighter offers. Thanks to these elements, we believe we will grow profitably, even if facing conditions similar to those that we faced before the pandemic.”\n\nHow will LATAM increase its cargo fleet?\n\nLATAM ended 2021’s first quarter with 283 passenger aircraft and eleven cargo planes, all B767-300F. The carrier is in the process of actively reshaping its long-haul commercial passenger fleet. The airline has already rejected the lease contracts of eleven Airbus A350-900s. It also reorganized and dismissed a few leases and orders for new Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Now, it will significantly decrease its fleet of seventeen Boeing 767-300ER.\n\nOriginally, LATAM’s freighter fleet growth plan included four firm conversion orders and four options. Two months after the initial announcement, LATAM has exercised the four options and added two more 767-300ERs to the mix. This brings the freighter fleet to 21 aircraft by the end of 2023. It will almost double cargo capacity and reduce the average fleet age from 17 to 14 years.\n\nLargest cargo operator in Latin America\n\nAccording to the International Air Travel Association (IATA), Latin America has been the worst performer of all regions within the airline industry. There’s a variety of reasons that can explain this, but overall, the main one is the weak economic performance of Latin American countries. Despite that, LATAM now has the opportunity to strengthen its capacity to, from, and within South America. The group can also position itself as the leading freighter operator in the region.\n\nLATAM expects to receive the first four converted aircraft between 2021 and 2022, plus six more between 2022 and 2023. Kamal Hadad, LATAM Cargo’s Network and Alliances Director said: “In general terms, the majority of the plan focuses on improving connectivity between North and South America. In particular, capacity from Colombia and Ecuador will be strengthened to support the flower export industry. Additional flights to support Chilean salmon exports as well as import traffic into the country. Capacity to and from Brazil will also go up as we add routes from North America and Europe.”\n\nDaniel Martínez Garbuno See Full Bio Daniel Martínez Garbuno is a Mexican journalist.

    text: "International wealth manager Brainvest has hired the former CEO of Julius Baer’s Brazilian family office operation to lead its business in Brazil and has also named a new global CEO as part of its international growth strategy, the firm announced on Wednesday.\n\nJan Gunnar Karsten (pictured, right), a 20-year industry veteran who spent more than 11 years with Julius Baer Family Office in Brazil before his departure in March, has been appointed Brainvest’s new Brazil CEO. He is replacing Fernando Gelman (pictured, center) who has been appointed Brainvest’s global CEO.\n\nIn his new post, Karsten has been charged with ‘creating a clear path for Brainvest to scale its ecosystem across Latin America,’ the firm said in its announcement. He will also play a key role in hiring for its relationship management teams and developing private offerings for international clients, the group added.\n\nMeanwhile, Gelman will now look to support the CEOs of each of the firm’s businesses in its staple markets of Switzerland, Brazil and the US. He has been with the firm since 2007.\n\n‘As an independent multi-family office that serves our clients in a unique way, we are positioning ourselves as a natural home for wealth managers in Latin America to expand their practice on an international scale,’ said Gelman.\n\nThe firm secured a minority investment from serial RIA investor Merchant Investment Management in December last year to help support Brainvest’s strategy of expanding across Latin America, specifically in Peru.\n\n‘The hiring [of Karsten] solidifies Brainvest as a key player in the global multi-family office space and is executing a strategic plan that began in 2019 with the arrival of Alex Gorra as partner, followed by the acquisition of 20% of the company by Merchant Investment Management at the end of last year,’ the firm said in its announcement on Wednesday.\n\nGorra was hired in 2019 and has become a key player in Brainvest’s international growth plans.\n\nBrainvest was founded in 2003 and specializes in providing its client base of families and entrepreneurs with access to alternative investments.\n\nIt has $3bn in total assets under management (AUM) which includes an RIA unit it runs from Miami that reported $769.5m in AUM as of December last year, according to its latest form ADV.",

      "'We had to look for opportunities elsewhere': Cabify founder on LatAm expansion",
    text: "Long one of Spain’s only two unicorns, ride-hailing startup Cabify is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month. After a rocky start in Madrid in 2011, the company launched operations in Mexico, Peru, and Chile just one year later, and is now also present in Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador and Uruguay.\n\nCabify says it now has 33 million registered users globally and more than 400,000 collaborating drivers. It also offers e-scooters and e-mopeds under the Movo brand name, long-term bike rental under Bive, the WiBle car-sharing service and a delivery service called Cabify Envíos.\n\nFounder and CEO Juan de Antonio spoke to Tech.eu’s Crossing Borders series about how Spain's attitude 10 years ago forced them to expand abroad very quickly.\n\n“That initial expansion was triggered by the lack of opportunities in our home market,” de Antonio says. “In Spain, the regulation didn’t allow for many options so we had to look for opportunities elsewhere.”\n\nThe Cabify chief has been vocal in his criticism of the Spanish government in the past, particularly in regards to Madrid’s tendency to safeguarding traditional industries. He told the Financial Times in 2018 that since Cabify started in Spain, “the Spanish state has felt like more of a hindrance than a help.”\n\n“It’s strange that the country we have generally been made the least welcome by the government is our home, Spain,” de Antonio told the paper.\n\nHe told Tech.eu that five years ago he might even have said it was a mistake to launch first in Spain as opposed to going straight into Latin America, “but then the regulatory framework in Spain changed and we adapted to the local reality and we have a very successful operation in Spain.”\n\nHowever, he feels that the Spanish government still needs to understand that the world is changing and that a medium-term plan is essential to ensure people are not left behind in the long term.\n\nFor one, the sheer amount of high-calibre engineering talent in Spain gives the country an edge — Cabify’s Spanish engineers are on par with any in the world, according to de Antonio.\n\n“Spain has a huge opportunity to leverage this transformation… we as a country need to take advantage of that, it means setting the corporate rules that will allow innovation to happen in Spain as opposed to having innovation happen elsewhere...and it doesn't create any value for Spain or for Europe.”\n\nEU needs to step up\n\nCabify is one of 35 members the new 'EU Unicorns Group', which launched in March with the goal to boost European tech innovation leadership, and help create more European ‘global champions.’ The group is calling for the EU to set up a €100bn sovereign tech fund.\n\n“We’re not talking about giving tech startups a head start over other countries, we are talking about making Europe competitive with the rest of the world,” de Antonio says. “Things as simple as stock options, that are basic in the US or the UK, the way to provide this to your employees are different in every market in the EU; in Spain, it is a total nightmare.\n\n“In terms of technology and innovation we are sometimes afraid that new companies will disrupt existing companies and that's going to create trouble down the road.\"\n\nThe ins and outs of market expansion\n\nWhen considering new markets, the Cabify founder believes it is equally as important to know when to pull out as when to expand, especially if the economics are not working, or if the competitive dynamics are unsustainable, or you have other geographies where your resources could produce better returns. “You can always go back to a market when conditions change,” he adds.\n\nBrazil is one such market for Cabify. The company announced in April this year that they were shuttering their operations in the South American country, where they had been since 2016, citing unprofitability and the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“At some point in time we had to decide where to focus our efforts and had to recognise that it was a market that was far from reaching profitability,” he says. “We’ve done this with some other markets in the past and in some we’ve come back whenever the conditions have changed and hopefully we can do that in Brazil soon, but right now the market is not a priority for us.”\n\nSpain’s other unicorn, the food-delivery app Glovo, completely exited Latin America in September 2020, selling off its operations to Delivery Hero.\n\nGlovo co-founder and CEO Oscar Pierre told Tech.eu last month that in the food-delivery sector, being the market leader is hugely important, and it is vital to learn to “shut down very fast” in a market if they did not have a “clear path to number one.”\n\nAlso read: Know when to hold ’em, know when to fold ’em: Glovo CEO talks about their expansion hits and misses\n\nFor ride-hailing however, being the first to market is not that relevant for success, de Antonio says, noting that food delivery is more like a natural monopoly, while the mobility sector is more of an oligopoly.\n\n“I would argue that what matters most is that you build value beyond the commodity so in the long term you originate and can differentiate,” he says, meaning for example, investment in carbon neutrality and paying taxes in all the countries where you operate.\n\nCabify has two different business models in Spain and Latin America. In Spain, cars for transporting customers need to have special licences, and these tend to be mostly owned by companies with fleets of cars. This means drivers are employed on proper work contracts by the companies.\n\nIn LatAm, Cabify is still using the gig-economy model where the drivers are self-employed with their own cars. De Antonio says they are planning to export the Spanish model to Latin American markets, as it is working well in Spain, but they don't have a date for it as yet.\n\nJuan de Antonio’s expansion tips\n\n> Balance the resources you have with how many mistakes you can allow yourself.\n\nHe says that striking a balance between spreading yourself too thin and building a strong playbook by market is so tough that many startups either expand too slowly or too fast.\n\n“We spread ourselves too thin for a number of years, until early 2014, when for the first time in our history we got a significant amount of money as Series A and it allowed us to have execution that was not biased by running out of cash in a matter of days,\" he says. \"The business grew very rapidly and in a sustainable manner and that allowed us to expand to different markets.”\n\n> Latin America is not necessarily the obvious expansion choice for Spanish startups.\n\n“I would argue that it is easier to expand within Europe than to go from Spain to Latin America—the cities are very different for starters,” he says, adding that there are so many differences and nuances in the language that it can actually be a disadvantage.",

    title: "Cross-border CCS advancing in APAC as value chain expands",
    text: "The Asia Pacific (APAC) region is rapidly emerging as a key player in the carbon capture and storage (CCS) sector, reports Rystad Energy. Australia could be a major player in the emerging sector, but some hurdles need to be overcome before it can edge out the regional competition.\n\nAsian countries are intensifying their decarbonisation efforts, despite challenges for a number of countries in the region, such as unsuitable geological conditions for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Rystad Energy's research highlights Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia as emerging hubs in the APAC region, driven by the carbon dioxide (CO2) storage potential in their depleted oil and gas reservoirs and stricter environmental regulations, despite recent improvements and updates in policy. The increasing recognition of the potential of these reservoirs, combined with the urgency to reduce emissions spurring demand for CO2 storage, position the region to attract a substantial portion of the up to $15 billion in anticipated investment in CCUS across APAC, which is expected over the next decade, said Rystad.\n\nSoutheast Asia promising CCS contender\n\nSoutheast Asia emerges as a promising contender in the region, offering some of the most cost-effective CO2 storage options across the APAC region, finds Rystad. This attractiveness has prompted countries like Japan and South Korea, eager for cross-border solutions, to forge alliances with counterparts such as East Asian companies, as well as Southeast Asian and Australian players. Notable among these are Malaysia's Petronas, Indonesia's Pertamina and Australian companies like Santos and Woodside Energy. This growing regional collaboration is fuelled by the high population density and constrained domestic infrastructure in certain Asian nations, compelling them to explore storage solutions beyond their borders, noted the consultancy.\n\nCCS momentum building\n\nMomentum is already building on policies in Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia to address regulatory gaps and pave the way for them to become key CO2 storage hubs in the region.\n\nThe availability of depleted oil and gas fields, combined with ample storage capacity, infrastructure viability and supportive regulations, further incentivises CO2 storage initiatives in these countries.\n\nUnlocking CCS value chain\n\n\"The race is on for CO2 mitigation leadership in APAC. Policymakers are taking steps to close regulatory gaps to fully unlock the CCS value chain and create a friendly investment environment through project incentives. Ultimately, the region with the most cost-effective solutions and a clear path for CO2 storage will win. Strong government action, encompassing financing and establishing a standardised CCS framework, will also be vital,\" says Sohini Chatterjee, Senior Analyst at Rystad Energy.\n\nExpanding from CCS to CCUS, last year was a record-breaker in APAC, with the region adding more new projects than in any previous year. These initiatives accounted for more than half (51%) of the region's total CO2 capture capacity, surpassing the cumulative capacity of all previous years. The surge in capacity was predominantly driven by announcements from Australia, East Asia and Southeast Asia, propelled by policies and regulations aimed at driving cross-border CCUS across the region.\n\nEast Asia spearheaded the CCUS project count, with China, South Korea and Japan taking the lead. However, the approach to CCUS differs notably between these countries. China prioritises the development of national projects, leveraging its abundant sub-surface reservoirs for permanent storage or enhanced oil recovery (EOR), both onshore and offshore. In contrast, South Korea and Japan focus on cross-border projects with permanent storage, in addition to their national initiatives.\n\nIndia CCS\n\nSynergia Energy's Cambay CCS hub in India marks a significant development for South Asia. This project aims to capture and store CO2 emissions from nearby combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) and coal plants in Gujarat's Cambay field. With a projected capacity of 46 million tonnes per annum (tpa), it has the potential to become the largest hub project in the Asia Pacific region. However, achieving this goal will be challenging due to limited government support for CCS initiatives and a lack of technical expertise to move beyond the research and development (R&D) stage in India.\n\nJapan-Australia CCS collaboration\n\nJapan-Australia collaboration, although limited to 10 projects identified in last year's analysis, holds significant importance for the region, said Rystad. This is exemplified by agreements forged between Santos and Japanese entities, like JX Nippon Oil & Gas and Eneos, aiming to import up to a substantial 20 million tpa by 2040. Further highlighting Australia's importance to CO2 storage advancement in the region, Western Australia's appeal for transnational CCS endeavours is also apparent. Collaborations between Japanese companies and Australian players, such as Woodside Energy and DeepC Store, are exploring the potential capture, storage and transportation of CO2 from Japan for injection and storage off the Western Australian coast.\n\nAustralia's commitment to carbon abatement is evident through incentives like Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) and various funding initiatives supporting CCS projects. Unlike its Asian counterparts, Australia boasts comprehensive CO2 storage regulations spanning federal Commonwealth waters, and on a provincial level in states like Queensland and Victoria. Australia's extensive CO2 storage potential is supported by stringent permitting regulations, ensuring responsible CCS project management.\n\nCCS hurdles in Australia\n\nAustralia achieved a significant milestone for CO2 storage last year by ratifying the London Protocol, but the bill includes a key limitation. It only allows for the export of CO2, not its import. This means CO2 storage projects would still need permits and approvals under separate state or territory regulations, creating an unnecessary hurdle that partially undermines the progress.\n\nThe London Protocol, for example, shows that gaps in regulation persist for Australia, hindering cross-border CCS pathways. While financial support exists, it falls short of covering project costs, with current government funding in the range of US$10 million – $30 million. Additionally, the continent's distance from major East Asian emitters may raise transportation costs, posing a challenge compared to regional competitors like Malaysia and Indonesia. Time will tell whether Australia, Malaysia or Indonesia are ultimately able to lead the region in cross-border CCS, or if other key players in the region emerge.\n\nPolicymakers in most of the world's advanced economies have committed to decarbonise, and Australia's leaders are no exception.\n\nCrucially, CCS could be the magic bullet needed – potentially a very effective solution to the decarbonisation and net zero challenges, as ENB's CCS Report 2024 found.\n\nHowever, unlike Northern America and Western Europe, the Australian government does not appear to see the same urgency in encouraging and implementing CCS at scale, as a key tool in helping to hit decarbonisation goals. In its special report, Energy News Bulletin (ENB) explores the current status and potential of CCS in Australia, as well as its performance relative to other global jurisdictions.",

Avaya is a market leader with 145 million seats worldwide, making it uniquely positioned to help enterprise customers transition to the cloud at scale.\n\nAvaya ReadyNow is delivered under a single global delivery model across its international network of Avaya-hosted and partner data centres, providing availability in 34 countries, with consistent and predictable levels of service provided from all locations. Both a UK and a Germany-based Avaya-hosted data centre are now live, enabling enterprises based in these locations the ability to address local data security and compliance requirements.\n\nThese data centres host pre-built Virtual Private Clouds with interoperability to existing Avaya on-premise applications and assets. The dedicated software allows Avaya customers to add customised security measures as needed and operate in a hybrid environment, allowing customers to quickly realize the benefits of cloud. For large enterprises, Avaya ReadyNow also offers the option to add customisation on top to ensure consistent user experience and business process workflows during migration.\n\nAyman Majzoub, Senior Director of Sales for Avaya Enterprise Cloud, said, “Many enterprise IT leaders are interested in the benefits of a public cloud offering, such as an opex-based consumption model, flexibility and speed of deployment. But control and security concerns, along with the more limited manageability and customisation options from upstart cloud CCaaS and UCaaS vendors, have slowed adoption for the larger requirements.”\n\n“Our new delivery model and automation tools mean that Avaya ReadyNow is just that – infrastructure and packaged software can be deployed faster. Because the standard configurations are pre-built and pre-staged, we’ve been able to reduce what might otherwise take several thousand hours of build time down to a matter of minutes. And for more advanced configurations, we can quickly have a system set up and ready to be customized for our customers’ specifications.”\n\nZeus Kerravala, Principal Analyst at ZK Research, said, “Cloud has become a central feature of the new operating model for digital businesses, with 80 percent of future Contact Centre deployments forecasted to be either private cloud or hybrid cloud and on-premise solutions. This is being driven by customer demand for security control over data and networks, while retaining the option to migrate to a hybrid environment. With UC and CC adoption in the cloud continuing to grow, Avaya ReadyNow Private offers a very attractive proposition for those business leaders looking for a way to efficiently transform their communications without having to rebuild their workflows from scratch.”",

      "Tech consultancy MTX picks Adelaide as first step in APAC expansion",
    text: "Adelaide will welcome the creation of a further 500 high-paying jobs, with tech consultancy MTX Group selecting the city as its first Asia Pacific hub.\n\nUS-based tech consulting and services firm MTX Group has selected Australia as its Asia Pacific launchpad, with its first downunder delivery centre to be established in Adelaide. The expansion will create 2,500 Australian jobs, with 500 of those committed to South Australia, and follows closely on the heels of first Accenture and then PwC announcing new centres in Adelaide, bringing 2000 and 300 jobs respectively in the coming years.\n\n“We are committed to creating positive impacts in local communities and Adelaide became the obvious first delivery hub in Australia because of the culture and the ambitious plan by the regional government with a clear ten year vision to innovation and a thriving economy,” said MTX CEO Das Nobel, who together with Nipa Nobel established the Texas-based firm in its current guise in 2018. Today, it has over 680 employees listed on LinkedIn.\n\nWith aspirations of becoming a billion-dollar company by 2025, MTX covers a range of technology and consulting services, including Salesforce and Google Cloud implementations and propriety AI and machine-learning platforms. The company has over the past year won a number of sizeable Covid response contracts in the US, including beating out the likes of Accenture and IBM on a $295 million contract-tracing management tender in Texas.\n\nMTX’s Australian practice will be led by co-founder and CEO Ben Papps, a former management consultant with Boston Consulting Group and more recently executive manager for the NBN. Papps cited the city’s artificial intelligence and data analytics credentials as one of the firm’s attractions to Adelaide, with the Australian Institute for Machine Learning and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Living Lab both having been established in South Australia in the past couple years.\n\n“AIML is a world-class research facility and the MIT Living Lab, which is one of only three labs outside the United States, offers a global collaboration between MIT, government and business within Adelaide,” Papps said. “MTX is excited to partner with these, and other research initiatives, that enable safe and secure data analysis to identify growth opportunities and improve government decision-making and socio-economic outcomes.”\n\nAttending the launch alongside federal finance minister Simon Birmingham, state premiere Stephen Marshall said, “South Australia offers a unique platform through research, skills and collaborations that will enable development opportunities in artificial intelligence, space technology, renewable energy and health.”\n\n“MTX will be able to bridge academic consortiums and businesses in a mutual partnership that provides salient training internships and high-paying jobs.”\n\nIn what the firm says is a clear demonstration of its commitment to the state, MTX followed up its launch by announcing a five year naming rights sponsorship deal for the Stadium Club at Adelaide Oval, with the revamped ‘MTX Club’ unveiled at the Adelaide versus Port Adelaide showdown over the weekend. “MTX looks forward to connecting with businesses in a local setting, and Adelaide Oval provided a great fit for us,” Papps stated.",

      "Kredito banks $6M as the LatAm business lender eyes international expansion",
    text: "Over a year after grabbing $4 million in pre-seed funding, Chile-based Kredito, a business lending startup, is back with another $6 million in new funding.\n\nThe company launched to the public in 2021 and partners with financial institutions to help small businesses with their spend management, access digital unsecured loans, open a bank account and obtain a business credit card.\n\nWhen we profiled Kredito last year, Sebastian Robles, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that business credit didn’t automatically come with an account, leaving business owners to use personal credit cards.\n\n“Everyone wants to sell online, so e-commerce capabilities are key,” he told TechCrunch recently. “Most of our customers are moving online, but what’s happened is that banks are more restricted with their products, making it harder for the unbanked or the underbanked to access decent financial services or sometimes even a bank account.”\n\nInstead, Kredito takes on that risk by using a proprietary algorithm and alternative data to evaluate credit risk more inclusively than traditional banks, and in real time, Robles said. It also created products with few requirements so that it could reduce the cost of acquisition and gather data from customers on how best to help them access financial products. For example, the account and corporate card can be used by anyone, while the loan product is accessible to those who qualify and share data with Kredito, Robles said.\n\nIncluding the new equity funding round — Robles is still finalizing a debt round — the company has raised $11.5 million in equity and debt so far. The new capital came from a group of angel investors and family offices, including Cornershop by Uber founders, Oskar Hjertonsson and Daniel Undurraga, and various partners from real estate developer Patio.\n\nRobles wasn’t necessarily planning to go after new capital this soon, but said Kredito was growing faster than expected. He has run the company very lean, but needed to add to the small team to meet growth.\n\nThe company has about 100,000 accounts and approximately 5,000 active users and is seeing 90% revenue growth month over month, he said. It is focused on maintaining that growth throughout the next year as it continues to open thousands of new accounts each month.\n\nRobles intends to use the new capital to expand into new countries and consolidate its growth in Chile. Exporting Kredito’s product — making sure what it does in Chile it can do in other countries — will be key, he said. As such, the company will work first on its underwriting by accessing data in multiple countries and replicating its strategies.\n\n“Internationalization is the main focus,” he added. “We have a lot of work to do. We have made a lot of progress in the underwriting and the loans, and now we have to do the same with other products. Locally, we will focus on growth. We already have product market fit and a lot of traction, and now we want to grow more.”",

    title: "DEUNA enters LatAm’s one-click checkout sector with $37M",
    text: "DEUNA, a Silicon Valley-based one-click checkout commerce startup, is officially joining Latin America’s nearly $100 billion e-commerce sector with $30 million in Series A funding after largely staying under the radar since being founded in late 2020.\n\nCo-founders Roberto Enrique Kafati Santos and Jose Maria Serrano started the company after a career at McKinsey leading digital payments for Kafati Santos and in private equity at Carlyle for Serrano. They also recently brought on Jose Jorge Molina, who was previously chief marketing officer for Bitso, to join the founding team to lead marketing.\n\n“People were looking for help digitizing their businesses, and as we started looking into this, realized that brands needed help selling online,” Kafati Santos told TechCrunch. “At the time, we didn’t understand the opportunity to do an e-commerce platform, but the decision was obvious, and we have done payments ever since. We helped several brands last year and have now increased customer sales five times.”\n\nE-commerce is a hot market in Latin America, with the founders estimating it will grow 30% each year. However, they say the market continues to be plagued by three challenges: customer acceptance, conversion and fraud.\n\nThat’s why they say they are building a “Commerce 3.0” that will tackle all three of those. DEUNA provides a payments infrastructure that integrates with major payment providers and alternative payment methods and provides merchants access to more than 3 million users. In addition, merchants can use the tools to handle payment orchestration, payment processing, fraud prevention and lifecycle management based on actionable user real-time analytics.\n\nIn particular, to combat acceptance, DEUNA will offer multiple payment methods, which Kafati Santos believes will also help solve the problem of conversion, where some 70% of customers abandon their cart at checkout. The company has been able to increase acceptance rates by 40% and prove out about three times higher conversion rates, he said.\n\nIn Latin America, that is often due to about half of customers not having their payment method of choice approved. On top of that, those whose payment is approved, one in 20 payments are fraudulent, for example, a payment made with a stolen credit card, he added. That’s why DEUNA is building its own fraud tech with custom rules for merchants that cuts down on payment fraud and denials.\n\nWith a rather large e-commerce market, a lot of one-click competitors have entered, mainly driven by the consumer buying behavior shift that took place over the past two years. We recently saw Sleek raise $1.7 million to get started in a space that is dominated by companies like Ownit, Bolt, Checkout.com, OurPass and Rapyd, which have collectively raised more than $3 billion in investments within the past 18 months. During that time, Colombia-based Addi said it was getting into the one-click space after taking in a $75 million extension to its Series B.\n\nKafati Santos said DEUNA has been able to differentiate itself from many of the players in that it is solving the whole acceptance-conversion-fraud triangle, whereas others are just going after pieces of it.\n\nOver the past two years, Kafati Santos and Serrano had bootstrapped the business for the most part, with the exception of a $7 million seed round in October 2021. They have grown revenue 120 times in the last year and brought on clients, including KFC, Pappos and Dunkin’ Donuts.\n\nThis new investment of $30 million was led by Activant Capital, with participation from Valor Capital, Abstract Ventures, Acrew Capital, Upload Ventures and a group of individual founder investors from companies including Plaid, Kavak, Jeeves, Xepelin, iFood and R2. The company raised a total of $37 million.\n\nThe founders plan to use the new capital to expand its presence in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Chile, product development, go-to-market, adding employees to its team of 90 and entering new countries, like Brazil, in the coming months.\n\nDavid Yang, partner at Activant Capital, said his firm has invested in a number of fintech companies and believes DEUNA is doing something unique.\n\n“Raising a $30M Series A is hard in any market, but with their backdrop, we had high conviction in what they are doing,” Yang said. “This is a big market opportunity, in some ways more compelling than the U.S. DEUNA’s approach is also holistic rather than just pieces of the market. The team, and the vision they had with Jose (Molina) joining, has had strong execution to date.”",

    text: "29 Shares Email\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nBrazil commerce platform Nuvemshop is back with a $90 million Series D, five months after securing $30 million in Series C funding.\n\nSubscribe to the Crunchbase Daily\n\nNuvemshop, known as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking countries, was founded in 2011 and offers a suite of tools around payments, shipping, inventory management and marketing for online businesses. It currently serves nearly 80,000 merchants across Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.\n\nAccel led the new round with participation from ThornTree Capital and existing investors including Kaszek and Qualcomm Ventures, as well as a group of e-commerce leaders including Mike Micucci, Mark Lavelle, Mark Lenhard, Jamie Sutton, Kevin McKeand and Minesh Shah. The Series D brings Nuvemshop’s total funding to date to $128.4 million, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nDespite raising money last October, after meeting with Accel it made sense to move forward with another round of funding, Santiago Sosa, co-founder and CEO of Nuvemshop, told Crunchbase News\n\n“It was not about the money, but Ethan (Choi) and Andrew (Braccia) have experience in e-commerce and Latin America itself,” he added. “It is the right fit, and we feel confident that they will help in the next stage of our growth.”\n\nE-commerce is booming in Latin America, where there are more than 650 million consumers, with 479 million already connected online, Sosa said. At the same time, online retail sales in the region account for approximately $84 billion and is projected to hit $116 billion by 2023.\n\nHowever, Latin America continues to have low e-commerce penetration, presenting tremendous growth and economic impact in the region, Sosa said. For example, Brazil, the most populous country in the region with over 200 million people, doubled e-commerce penetration last year from 5 percent to 10 percent. However, he estimates penetration will grow dramatically, and could be 30 percent to 40 percent in 10 years, he added.\n\n“When we think about the future, we envision commerce will be digitized,” he added. “We are at the beginning of a transition where the infrastructure needs to be built. All of these smaller merchants need payments and logistics tools.”\n\nIn the past year, Nuvemshop tripled its customer base and its revenue, Sosa said. The new funding will enable Nuvemshop to continue developing new capabilities, including tools for payments and logistics management. It will also expand its presence in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, as well as establish itself in new markets, including Colombia, Chile and Peru.\n\nAs part of the investment, Andrew Braccia, partner at Accel, joins Nuvemshop’s board. He believes the company is building a product that creates opportunity for local merchants to connect with customers, and the new round enables Nuvemshop to build a stronger balance sheet and take advantage of opportunities in Brazil and Argentina.\n\n“Over the last 12 to 18 months, there is an urgency and a real need for merchants and customers to be able to move toward an e-commerce solution,” Braccia said. “Santi and his team are taking an underpenetrated market and providing a product that is becoming a critical product to have for merchants and customers. It’s not a question of inevitability, it was when and it just happened to have been through a pandemic.”\n\nPhoto of Santiago Sosa, co-founder and CEO of Nuvemshop, courtesy of the company.\n\nBlogroll illustration: Li-Anne Dias",

      "Canadian vitamin maker Jamieson furthers APAC expansion with Indian pharmacy partnership",
    text: 'Under the agreement, selected Jamieson-branded products will be distributed in India, with the potential for more products to be added in future.\n\nThe second-largest pharmacy chain in India, MedPlus has 1,500 locations throughout the country, with plans to open another 3,500 retail outlets by 2023.\n\nJamieson is the first and only international supplement brand in MedPlus\' portfolio so far. The first shipment was released in September and has just been made available in retail stores.\n\nCapturing a fragmented market\n\nSpeaking to NutraIngredients-Asia​, Jamieson\'s corporate communications director Ruth Winker said: "We did a lot of research on India to determine the best way to bring the brand in. While the Indian market is large and growing — about the same size as the Canadian market — its retail landscape is very fragmented.​\n\n"Partnering with a large pharmacy chain like MedPlus will allow us to introduce products through their established locations and online store, simplifying the process. Our VP of international sales met with MedPlus for the first time in February 2017, and ongoing discussions led to the recent signing of our partnership agreement."​\n\nCurrently, Jamieson has made about a dozen of its products available on the Indian market, mainly consisting of staple items such as multivitamins and single-letter vitamins.\n\nWinker said, "As our partnership progresses, we will be assessing the opportunity to introduce more products, depending on what the market and regulations will allow."​\n\nThe company expects to attract similar types of consumers in India as it does in Canada — namely, those with rising disposable incomes, parents buying vitamins and dietary supplements for their children, and older consumers looking to maintain and improve their health as they age.\n\n"There is also a large Indian-Canadian population in Canada that we expect will influence the purchasing decisions of their family members living in India, where the market is very underdeveloped in all segments," said Winker.​\n\nAPAC strategy\n\nThe partnership with MedPlus is part of Jamieson\'s wider expansion strategy for Asia, where the latter had planned to increase its presence after filing for a $300m IPO last May​.\n\nThis has been aided by American private equity investment firm CCMP Capital Advisors, which owns a 44% stake in Jamieson after having agreed in 2014 to acquire the Canadian company for US$226.5m.\n\nApart from India and Hong Kong — the latter being one of Jamieson\'s oldest markets in the APAC region — the firm hopes to make an impact on the China market within the next year or so.\n\nWinker said: "The vitamin market in China is huge and fast-growing. We are continuing to register products there under the new regulations for domestic retail and e-commerce, and we expect to have upwards of 20 products registered for those channels by the end of 2019.​\n\n"We also recently signed a strategic partnership with JD.com, to help strengthen our presence in the cross-border e-commerce space in China. We are looking to expand to additional markets in South East Asia, and are continually in talks with both existing and potentially new distribution partners to open up these territories."​',

      "ChromaDex continues APAC expansion with launch of nicotinamide riboside product in third country",
    text: 'TRU NIAGEN, whose sole active ingredient is ChromaDex\'s patented nicotinamide riboside — named NIAGEN NR — in capsule form, is said to possess muscle, liver, cognitive, metabolic and even skincare benefits.\n\nSteady APAC growth\n\nThe product made its APAC debut last September, when the US-based ChromaDex partnered with Hong Kong retailer AS Watson​ to sell the product in over 100 Watsons stores across the country, as well as the company’s online store.\n\nIn January this year, Watsons brought TRU NIAGEN to Singapore​, where it is currently sold in more than 100 Watsons stores and its online retail store.\n\nRegarding its Kiwi expansion and deal with Matakana Superfoods, Will Black, VP of sales and marketing at ChromaDex, told NutraIngredients-Asia​: "We chose Matakana Superfoods as our exclusive New Zealand distributor because​ it’s an established dietary supplement manufacturer and marketer, and has broad channel access in New Zealand. ​\n\n"More importantly, however, Matakana Superfoods shares ChromaDex\'s belief in the importance of science- and evidence-based claims when it comes to marketing dietary supplements to consumers."​\n\nHe added that under this arrangement, TRU NIAGEN will be initially sold online at its NZ website, before being made available through various food and drug channels in the country.\n\nHe further said: "​An ageing population with growing concerns around metabolic health issues would likely provide the best growth opportunities for TRU NIAGEN in New Zealand.​\n\n"Besides that, increasing knowledge and understanding of mitochondrial health and the role that NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and nicotinamide riboside play in supporting long-term cellular health will also support our growth in New Zealand."​\n\nFuture focus\n\nWhile Black declined to reveal specific details about whether or not ChromaDex plans to launch TRU NIAGEN in other APAC markets, he said: "It\'s currently available in Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore. We launched in these markets initially because we have regulatory standing there.​\n\n"We have filed for regulatory approval in additional key markets in the region, and our dossiers are currently under review by the respective local country authorities. Ahead of those approvals, we are actively looking at options for collaborations and potential partnerships.”​\n\nChromaDex CEO Robert Fried had earlier said in a statement that the company would “continue the worldwide expansion of TRU NIAGEN”​, and were “selecting territories based on economics as well as strategic learnings”​.\n\nIn terms of ChromaDex’s product portfolio, Black said the firm would continue focusing on TRU NIAGEN for the time being.\n\n“Our primary focus this next year will be the continued growth of TRU NIAGEN in our home market, as well as international expansion as our regulatory status broadens.​\n\n"We will continue to support and invest in the science around NAD and nicotinamide riboside. We will, however, be open to looking at adjacent space opportunities as they present themselves."​\n\nPartners in expansion\n\nLike ChromaDex, Matakana Superfoods is eyeing APAC expansion.\n\nAfter finding e-commerce success on Amazon, the supplement manufacturer and distributor told NutraIngredients-Asia​ it wanted to establish a retail presence outside Australia, Chile and its native New Zealand.\n\nBusiness development manager Joseph Glucina had said the company was particularly interested in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nTRU NIAGEN\'s New Zealand launch has been scheduled for mid-September 2018.',

    text: 'Granted by public health organisation NSF International, the accolade recognises the firm\'s Specialty Botanicals & Extracts division, which manufactures authenticated and standardised natural extracts such as turmeric, fenugreek and green tea at the Hosur plant.\n\nSpeaking to NutraIngredients-Asia​, COO Chaitanya Desai said, "​We took part in this voluntary certification to demonstrate to our customers and industry that we hold ourselves to the most stringent standards of safety and quality. ​We maintain control over our supply chain and internal processes to ensure the quality and safety of the finished goods we supply to our customers."​\n\nGood sign for expansion goals\n\nThis bodes well for OmniActive in APAC, where it has been targeting an increase in business​.\n\nBusiness head of the firm\'s Specialty Botanicals & Extracts division, Thiyagarajan Karthikeyan, told NutraIngredients-Asia​: "Asian countries represent the largest market worldwide for herbs and botanicals, with a combined $15bn in annual sales, more than double that of the US market.​\n\n“We anticipate that they will continue to grow at a much faster rate than countries like the US, where the herbal market has matured. Consumer awareness about the benefits of dietary supplements in Asian markets and easy access to products are major market drivers.​\n\n"In China, the market has gained the attention of many supplement companies as those consumers increasingly spend on health products. E-commerce continues to be a major growth channel in China as well."​\n\nStill, the company will continue expanding its opportunities in developed markets like the US — which remains the world’s largest nutraceutical market — and in developing markets in Europe, where countries such as Germany and France are witnessing healthy growth rates.\n\nKarthikeyan added that OmniActive was investing in growing its presence in regional markets such as APAC and EMEA by offering a customised product portfolio "supported by effective and differentiated sales and marketing strategies for these regions"​.\n\nCasting a wide net​\n\nThe firm has cast a wide net, looking at global trends across different age groups, and where and how it can offer solutions.\n\nKarthikeyan said, "As obesity rates rise in regions outside the US, weight management formulas in meal and protein supplements have gained favour.​\n\n"In health categories for the ageing population, joint, digestive, and cognitive health are of major concern. Millennials are driving industry growth with products that address anxiety, stress, detoxification, and sports performance and recovery.​\n\n"Also, the preference for more natural, less processed products, along with other factors such as sustainability and clean labels, are driving the growth of the herbs and botanicals category. We aim to ensure that our portfolio of ingredients can cater to the needs of these fast-growing health categories."​\n\nFurthermore, he revealed that OmniActive was investing in R&D surrounding different delivery options for increased compliance and product efficacy.\n\n"We believe that a focus on consumer needs, innovation and science is essential to meeting the demands of supplement and functional food and beverage manufacturers, so they may provide quality products to consumers."​',

      "Westcon-Comstor expands cybersecurity partnership with Broadcom in APAC",
    text: "Westcon-Comstor, a specialist distributor and global technology provider, has unveiled plans to expand its exclusive cybersecurity partnership with Broadcom in Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The move follows a successful two-year collaboration in North Asia, where Westcon-Comstor holds sole distributor rights for Broadcom's Symantec cybersecurity portfolio.\n\nThe enhanced partnership will facilitate accelerated growth and expanded recurring revenues for channel partners across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. The agreement, which previously focused solely on the small to medium-sized business (SMB) segment, has been widened to include channel partners catering to corporate customers.\n\nThe geographic and sector expansion ensues two years after Westcon-Comstor was appointed as the single distributor of Symantec's cybersecurity products for SMBs in North Asia. The markets involved in this partnership spanned China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Korea, and Mongolia.\n\nThroughout this collaboration period, Westcon-Comstor successfully integrated 1,700 transactional cybersecurity partners for Symantec in North Asia. Notably, these partners not only instigated substantial renewal action but also expanded Broadcom’s Symantec net-new business by over 20% on an annual basis.\n\nExcited about the expansion, Patrick Aronson, Chief Marketing Officer and APAC Executive Vice President at Westcon-Comstor, said, “Asia-Pacific has long been a market where Symantec has enjoyed commercial success and strong brand recognition. This new agreement means we are committing to a regional partnership, leveraging Symantec’s innovative solutions and providing a platform for accelerated growth for cybersecurity channel partners across APAC.”\n\nEchoing Aronson's sentiment, Cynthia Loyd, Vice President of Global Enterprise, Partner and Commercial Sales for Broadcom, asserted, “Westcon-Comstor’s expertise in cybersecurity, unparalleled channel reach across the region and deep understanding of our offering makes it the ideal aggregation and distribution partner for us. Together, we will bring the Symantec portfolio to a wider audience, creating new revenue opportunities for channel partners and enabling end-user customers to stay protected amid constantly evolving and increasingly complex security threats.”\n\nWestcon-Comstor remains the sole distributor of Symantec cybersecurity portfolio, a testament to its wide-ranging business network, deep industry acumen, and unrivalled capacity to foster accelerated growth in the ever-evolving cyber world.\n\nFor more information on this expanded partnership, current and prospective APAC partners can tune in to a webinar scheduled for Thursday, 29 February at 10.00am SGT.\n\nWestcon-Comstor is a global technology provider and specialist distributor, operating in more than 70 countries. It is focused on delivering business value and opportunity by connecting IT vendors with a channel of technology resellers, systems integrators and service providers. It combines industry insight, technical know-how and more than 30 years of distribution experience to deliver value and accelerate vendor and partner business success. It goes to market through two lines of business: Westcon and Comstor.",

      "AppOmni expands to Sydney with new data centre amid rising APAC demand",
    text: "AppOmni, a SaaS security firm, has unveiled a new data centre in Sydney, Australia. Hosted by Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the data centre serves as the provider for AppOmni's comprehensive SaaS security solutions. This development is a strategic response to the rising demand in the APAC region for advanced security measures to protect against sophisticated threats to SaaS applications.\n\nThis initiative is crucial in accommodating both private and public organisations that need to adhere to Australia's data sovereignty regulations. This includes the Privacy Act and the Australian Privacy Principles. These concerns over data sovereignty and security aren't exclusive to Australian shores, but are shared by 25% of Fortune 100 companies that depend on AppOmni for their SaaS security.\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform, as AppOmni’s Australian cloud data centre provider, ensures technical and organisational security measures that align with globally and locally recognised security assurance frameworks and certifications. These include APRA, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 27701, SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3. The IRAP-certified data centre aims to uphold the data privacy and data sovereignty requirements of businesses, critical infrastructure sectors, and government agencies alike.\n\nThe data centre will provide much-needed support for Australia-New Zealand organisations, granting them local access to AppOmni's cutting-edge SaaS Security Posture Management Service. The presence of regional data centres ensures lower latency and quicker response times, enhancing end-user experience and application performance.\n\nThe newly established facility also boasts the ability to provide robust monitoring of SaaS services in the APAC region. It focuses on efficient and proactive resource allocation to support increased user volumes and peaks of data traffic, minimising the risk of service disruptions and data loss.\n\nBrendan O’Connor, CEO and co-founder of AppOmni, comments on the significance of this move. \"In the rapidly evolving SaaS threat landscape, it's important to maintain a robust security posture,\" O’Connor states. \"As AppOmni leads the way in SaaS Security Posture Management, our expansion into Australia and the addition of the data centre represents a significant milestone in our own global growth. We are committed to helping our customers and partners in APAC meet local compliance standards — including APRA and ISM — and leverage insights gained from our experiences worldwide.\"\n\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve and data sovereignty increasingly comes to the fore, AppOmni's newest data centre reinforces its commitment to uphold international and local compliance standards, the company states. As such, it's clear that the expansion into Australia isn't just a move for AppOmni, but notable for the broader APAC region in its fight against the cyber threats of today and tomorrow.",

    title: "Italy’s Prysmian expands Brazil factory, opens LatAm HQ",
    text: "Italian cabling and fiber optics company Prysmian invested 150mn reais (US$39mn) to expand its Sorocaba factory in Brazil’s São Paulo state and open a Latin America operations headquarters in the city.\n\nWith the expansion, Prysmian says it has increased capacity at the plant by 25%, or by 500,000km of cables, to 2.5mn kilometers a year. The factory is the only one of its kind in Latin America with an end-to-end production cycle of fiber optics, Prysmian telecom business director Marcelo Andrade told BNamericas.\n\nAccording to Prysmian CEO for Latin America, Juan Mogollon, Sorocaba is also one of the group’s four “centers of excellence” in manufacturing, the others being in China, Italy and the US.\n\nThe Latin America HQ follows the acquisition last year of General Cable, which gave Prysmian a significantly larger footprint in the region, company executives said.\n\nThe launch was marked by an event on Wednesday in Sorocaba attended by Prysmian's global CEO Valerio Battista, Mogollon and Brazil country manager João Carro Aderaldo.\n\nThe launch also comes as Prysmian completes 90 years of operations in Brazil.\n\nThe company’s history in the country began in 1879, when Pirelli created a sector dedicated to energy cables. Around 50 years later the firm started manufacturing cables in Brazil.\n\nIn 2005, Pirelli’s cabling division was spun off worldwide, creating Prysmian. In 2011, Prysmian bought the Draka group and, last year, General Gable.\n\nLATIN AMERICA FOOTPRINT\n\nPrior to the incorporation of General Cable, Prysmian Brasil and Prysmian Argentina reported directly to Europe, while Prysmian Mexico reported to the US. Hence the need for a restructuring with a LatAm CEO and a LatAm HQ.\n\nWith the sites inherited from General Cable, the Prysmian group now has 16 manufacturing plants in Latin America: seven in Brazil, four in Mexico and one each in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina.\n\n“The reason for so many plants is that cable companies need to be closer to customers,” Battista said at the event.\n\nPrysmian also recently concluded the expansion of its factory in Durango, Mexico that is dedicated to telecom cables and which according to Andrade now has half the capacity of the Sorocaba plant.\n\nThe company also has three R&D centers in the region: two in Brazil and one in Chile, for the production of cables for the mining industry.\n\nIn Chile, Prysmian is also a supplier for the Fiber Optica Austral (FOA) submarine project to connect the far south of the country, Andrade said.\n\nOverall, 4,100 people work for Prysmian Latin America, 1,500 of whom are in Brazil.\n\nThe country was responsible for 1.9bn reais in revenues last year, or some 40% of the LatAm total.\n\nWorldwide, Prysmian reported 11.5bn euros (US$12.9bn) in sales in 2018, with Latin America accounting for some 9%. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 54%, the US and Canada 28% and Asia Pacific 9%.\n\nAccording to Battista, the revenue per geography is consistent with each region's potential except for Asia Pacific, where he said it is too low.\n\nIn terms of investments, the company allocated 250mn euros for capex and 105mn euros in R&D expenditures last year. It also launched 150 new products.\n\n“Energy is a very conservative market. Innovating in telecom is better because the market is not so regulated as the others and we're able to develop innovations much faster,” said Battista.\n\nFor 2019, Prysmian plans to up investments to 273mn euros, mostly due to an increase in fiber optics development and production.\n\nPrysmian’s main rival in Latin America is Furukawa, which has a slightly larger market share, according to Andrade.\n\nMERCOSUR-EU AND IMPORT TAX CUTS\n\nQuestioned by BNamericas, Mogollon said the company saw no immediate positive or negative direct impacts for Prysmian's business from the recently brokered Mercosur-European Union trade deal, which is still pending details and depends on ratification by each country.\n\nBut Mogollon admitted he was “worried, although not scared” about the Brazilian government’s decision – now suspended – to reduce and eventually eliminate import duties on IT and electronic goods, which some fear might lead to an influx of cheaper foreign products, hurting local manufacturing.\n\nAnd the executive downplayed the potential effects of changes to the rules that grant fiscal breaks for companies investing in R&D in Brazil, something also being considered by the government.\n\n“We're not located in any state where we use tax incentives that would impact us if they changed overnight. Some of our competitors are taking advantage of this. We're not. So we're not concerned.\n\n“Prysmian group has been around for 90 years in Brazil. The group has been able to navigate through the ups and downs in companies in Brazil and [elsewhere] in Latin America.”\n\nHe promised the company would stay at least another 90 years in the region, referring to a 90+plan.\n\n“I know it sounds like a slogan but we're really committed to the region and we're not scared by the political turbulence some of the countries in Latin America go through.”\n\nHowever, according to CEO Battista, the financial and political turbulence in Latin America “obviously scares” a lot of industries, but Pirelli and Prysmian have a lot of experience in dealing with that.\n\nBattista highighted the Argentine case.\n\n“Some of our competitors are leaving or have left Argentina. We want to stay there, even if there's a very complex financial situation. But sooner or later it will improve, similar to Brazil in the past two, three years. We need to be able to survive during the storm and when the storm is over it's a good market.”\n\nCIVIL CONSTRUCTION, ENERGY\n\nCountry manager Aderaldo said the local civil construction market is still struggling from the 2014-16 crisis. The segment is an important client for the group’s equipment.\n\nHe said the problem is related to a lack of confidence, arguing that “there is money available in banks.” This lack of confidence can soon change if the pension reform and other macro reforms are passed, according to Aderaldo.\n\nThe energy sector, on the other hand, is doing well. Generation and transmission are currently the main segments driving the company's investments in Brazil, he said.\n\n\"The energy market continues to grow in Brazil and we believe this trend will stay in coming years. Some investments are happening even independently of energy auctions.\"\n\nPrysmian expects renewables growth to be faster in countries like Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.\n\nSolar plant\n\nOne of Prysmian’s major projects in Brazil is the construction of the largest solar plant in the world, to be completed next year by Italian firm Enel Green Power and EPC company Tozzi in Piauí.\n\nPrysmian collaborated with Enel and Tozzi on the early stages and on the design and specification of the cables to meet Brazil and European standards, said Battista. When completed, the plant is due to supply over 13mn homes.\n\nAnother key project in the country is high voltage underground cables linking two substations in São Paulo: Piratininga and Bandeirantes.\n\nTELECOM\n\nAs for telecom, Prysmian expects triple digit growth in the internet service providers (ISP) segment to continue through 2022.\n\nAccording to Aderaldo, ISPs are taking 50% of the fiber produced by Prysmian in Brazil, with large telecom groups accounting for the rest.\n\nThe company leverages the expansion of broadband to remote areas by ISPs, as large operators are not capable of – or not interested in – serving these regions.\n\n“For a country with 210mn people like Brazil there's a gap in broadband to homes that needs to be addressed,” said Mogollon.\n\nIn order to support the expansion of infra, Prysmian allows ISPs to finance part of the fiber with a special card issued by a partner financial institution.\n\n“There are several sources of government funding for ISPs to purchase networks and equipment. In any case, we have partners who work with us to offer these sources of funding, whether public or private,” Aderaldo said.",

AdExchanger reported that BridgeID is essentially a synthetic ID that has already been integrated with The Trade Desk-pioneered Unified Identity 2.0 (UID2) and also works with identifiers such as Yahoo’s ConnectID, LiveRamp’s RampID and Experian’s LUID, helping to provide more data and higher match rates for advertisers looking to reach target audiences.\n\n“For the first time, since scaling our offering to thousands of advertisers in the US, we have expanded Disney’s Audience Graph and Clean Room technology to a global region beginning with Latin America, for more precise and performance-driven planning, buying and measurement,” said Dana McGraw, SVP of Data and Measurement Science at Disney, in a statement.\n\nAs for Mercado Libre (MELI), an online commerce and digital banking platform, the partnership involves multiple fronts. One aspect is bundling, with a previously disclosed distribution relationship where Disney+ Standard with Ads will be included in the company’s loyalty membership program MELI+, in Argentina. Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Columbia at launch.\n\nIt also calls for data and ad tech integrations, where brands in LATAM can now leverage MELI’s retail and purchase insights alongside Disney’s Audience Graph first-party data, through BridgeID, to target viewers on streaming. The partnership includes a direct connection between Mercado Ads demand-side platform (DSP) and Disney’s in-house Real Time Ad Exchange (DRAX) so brands can activate on biddable Disney+ inventory for programmatic buying, with data connections to the Audience Graph via BridgeID. It marks Disney’s latest direct DRAX integration with DSPs, having inked relationships with Google’s Display & Video 360 and The Trade Desk earlier this year. By directly integrating its streaming inventory through relationships like those with DSPs and MELI, which also utilize data, technology and automation, Disney can enable easier access to its inventory for advertisers – in this case those in LATAM specifically as Disney+ gears up for launch in the region - while also providing more performance and insights for brands.\n\n“This alliance empowers advertisers to enhance their use of retail media, improving performance and achieving superior campaign results by combining Disney’s advanced audience solutions with Mercado Libre’s extensive first-party data,” said Fernando Rubio, advertising VP of Mercado Libre, in a statement. “Advertisers can now reach users across the entire Mercado Libre ecosystem with a single campaign, whether they are shopping or enjoying Disney entertainment.”\n\nDisney+ in Latin America will offer a single unified app that brings together content like Marvel and Star Wars, as well as dedicated sections for Star+ general entertainment programming and ESPN sports rights, including live streaming of ESPN and ESPN 3 linear channels.\n\nIn March in the U.S. Disney launched a fully integrated Hulu-Disney+ app experience for subscribers of the Disney Bundle.\n\nOn the advertising front the company has been building up capabilities and features. That includes new interactive and shoppable ad formats powered by BrightLine and Kerv Interactive, respectively. On the retail data front it secured an agreement in May with Walmart Connect to pair the retailer’s audience and measurement data with Disney’s addressable streaming inventory and audience graph for enhanced targeting and outcome-based ad measurement. One aim of that partnership is for closed-loop attribution for brand campaigns that run across the Disney streaming portfolio, including Hulu and Disney+\n\nAs for international ambitions, Disney’s not the only streamer launching updated app experiences. Warner Bros. Discovery has touted early success of a Max roll out in 39 territories across Latin America and the Caribbean, along with recent and upcoming launches in Europe and APAC.",

      "MS Reinsurance eyes strategic expansion in LatAm: CUO (Americas), Segonzac",
    text: "In a recent interview with Reinsurance News, Louis de Segonzac, Chief Underwriting Officer (Americas) at MS Reinsurance, discussed the company’s strategic focus on expanding its presence in the Latin America (LatAm) market.\n\nSegonzac explained that MS Reinsurance maintains a healthy appetite for business in the region, and intends to increase participation strategically.\n\n“We will continue to restrain exclusive Property Cat relationships and will assess expansion opportunities where it makes sense,” he said.\n\nAs part of its strategy, MS Reinsurance has been closely monitoring market conditions. Segonzac commented that while the market has been stabilising following the 1/1 renewal, challenges still persist.\n\n“Rates in Mexico have been slightly disappointing due to some cedants not adequately responding to post-loss scenarios,” Segonzac noted.\n\nMoreover, Segonzac acknowledged broader issues impacting the insurance industry in LatAm. He highlighted the difficult decisions individuals face between maintaining their quality of life and investing in non-compulsory insurance.\n\nEconomic factors such as inflation also vary significantly across countries in LatAm. Segonzac stated, “MS Reinsurance has factored inflation into pricing for years but expresses greater concern about rising reconstruction costs and increasing legal awards, similar to concerns in the US market.”\n\nDespite these challenges, MS Reinsurance maintains a consistent strategic outlook, prioritising client support across all lines of business in LatAm and the Caribbean.\n\nSegonzac also shared insights from MS Reinsurance’s experience at the Miami Reinsurance Week 2024, which took place in mid-February, highlighting key takeaways from the event.\n\nHe described it as a successful event covering a wide range of topics, from pandemic and inflation discussions to current affairs such as natural disasters and political situations.\n\nAccording to Segonzac, the primary focus of the event was on “the current situation in each client’s country, with a recurring theme of concerns about the challenges of replacing capacity, particularly following a catastrophic event.”",

    title: "Stack Data Centres Kicks Off APAC Expansion in Singapore",
    text: "US hyperscaler Stack Infrastructure is expanding its digital infrastructure operations into the Asia Pacific region, starting with key cities in Japan after officially unveiling its Singapore presence in an announcement yesterday.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by private equity fund manager IPI Partners, Stack will make its initial entry into the region in Tokyo and Osaka, with plans to expand its network shortly thereafter into Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and other key hubs in Asia Pacific.\n\n“The launch of Stack Asia Pacific represents an exciting milestone in the evolution of our company,” said Brian Cox, chief executive officer of Stack. “We are committed to building out international markets that are strategic to our customers, and our expansion to Asia Pacific is a natural next step in offering flexible critical infrastructure solutions that meet and support their complex and evolving requirements.\n\nThe announcement makes Stack, which has nearly 1300 megawatts of hyperscale capacity in operation or under development across 21 North American locations, the latest US player to enter Asia’s increasingly competitive digital infrastructure race.\n\nBuilding an APAC Presence\n\nWith financial support from IPI, Stack intends to partner with landowners and real estate platforms to establish a pan-APAC presence, “through a combination of acquisitions and organic development,” the company said in a press release late Wednesday.\n\nTo lead that expansion, Stack has appointed Pithambar “Preet” Gona as chief executive officer for Asia Pacific, based in Singapore. Before joining the US firm, Gona was president and chief financial officer of Bridge Data Centres, a Singapore-based hyperscale and wholesale data centre provider which merged with ChinData Holdings in 2019.\n\n“Stack has proven itself as a trusted partner to hyperscale and enterprise customers through its innovative technical solutions and commercial models. I am excited by the opportunity to leverage Stack’s tremendous success in North America, which we look to replicate in the Asia Pacific region,” Gona said.\n\nAlso joining the Stack team in Singapore is former CBRE executive director Tom Duncan, who now leads business development in the region and will oversee the company’s partnerships with developers and operators in Asia Pacific.\n\nMingtiandi reached out to both Stack and IPI for further details but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nHyper-Scaling Up\n\nIPI launched Stack in January 2019 after completing the acquisition of Infomart data centres and its three operating assets in 2018. The investment firm then combined that portfolio with facilities acquired through investments in T5 Data Centres to create a 100MW US market player.\n\nThe investment fund then appointed former Infomart head Brian Cox as CEO of Stack.\n\nIPI, or Iron Point Iconic, is an investment manager established in 2016 by partners Iron Point and Iconiq Capital to acquire, develop, lease and operate digital infrastructures.\n\nThe firm has already raised $5.25 billion equity following a $3.8 billion fund raising round in April of this year. Led by Divesh Makan, Iconiq provides wealth management services to high net worth Silicon Valley leaders, with Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and Reid Hoffman reported to be among its investors.\n\nJust four months after its April fund raising, IPI expanded its European presence by acquiring Norwegian data centre firm DigiPlex for an undisclosed amount, after picking up Milan-based Supernap Italia in February.\n\nCurrently IPI’s data centre assets have a combined capacity of 880 megawatts, with 480 megawatts currently leased, making it among the biggest privately held portfolios in the world.\n\nBridging the Pacific\n\nNow IPI sees an opportunity to expand its services to the major Internet firms filling up hyperscale facilities by setting up Stack in APAC.\n\n“IPI is committed to investing in Asia Pacific and to addressing our customers’ growing need for digital infrastructure around the world,” Matt A’Hearn, partner at IPI, said in the statement.\n\nStack’s APAC expansion announcement comes a day after the firm announced the opening of a new 32 megawatt data centre facility in Silicon Valley, after commencing operations at Manassas, Virginia location in August.\n\nOther projects in the pipeline for Stack include a 24-megawatt data center development in Portland, Oregon aimed to open in the fourth quarter; a 125-acre (51-hectare) hyperscale campus in Prince William County, Virginia; a 400-acre facility in Alliance, Texas; and a 79-acre property in Avondale, Arizona.\n\nMarket Competition\n\nInvestments in data centres across Asia Pacific have surged this year in a bid to meet rising demand from mobile data usage and cloud service adoption.\n\nUS hyperscale market leader Digital Realty said in July that it had spent $66 million to acquire a site in Seoul, South Korea for its second facility in that country, with that event coming just two weeks after the REIT announced a joint venture with Brookfield to develop, own and operate data centres in India.\n\nIn June, SIngapore-based Princeton Digital Group, which is backed by US private equity firm Warburg Pincus revealed plans to invest $1 billion to develop a 97MW hyperscale facility near Tokyo, as it expands its APAC network.\n\nJust last week, announced a partnership with Australia’s Goodman to develop and lease two server facilities measuring 60,000 square metres (645,834 square feet) in Inzai City in Tokyo.",

    title: "PGIM Enters APAC Data Centres with Equinix Australia JV",
    text: "PGIM Real Estate is set to make its first Asia Pacific data centre investment after teaming up with Equinix to form a $575 million joint venture that will expand the network infrastructure giant’s hyperscale footprint into Australia.\n\nThe property fund management unit of US financial services giant Prudential has entered the joint venture partnership to build and operate two hyperscale data centres under the Silicon Valley firm’s xScale brand in Sydney, Australia, with the pair of server facilities planned to yield 55 megawatts of power capacity once completed.\n\n“Several years ago, PGIM Real Estate spotlighted the tremendous growing need for cloud infrastructure across the Asia Pacific region as a key investment opportunity,” PGIM Real Estate’s head of Japan, Morgan Laughlin said. “The formation of this joint venture relationship with Equinix is an important milestone in the process of taking a research-led initiative from theory to practical implementation for the ultimate benefit of our investors,” added Laughlin, who is leading the firm’s regional data centre strategy.\n\nThe new venture would boost Equinix portfolio of xScale data centres globally, including projects under development, to 34 facilities carrying a capacity of over 675 megawatts. That set of server sheds is estimated to be valued at $7.5 billion following formation of this venture, or 9 percent more than the portfolio’s estimated total value in June this year when Equinix announced an agreement to expand an existing venture with frequent partner, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC,\n\nSupporting the Clouds\n\n“We believe that the demand growth story for high-quality, well-located hyperscale data centers in Sydney remains very compelling,” said Steve Bulloch, managing director and head of PGIM Real Estate for Australia. “We also anticipate continued consolidation and future barriers to entry in the sector.”\n\nThe announcement of the partnership came nine months after PGIM raised a total of $1 billion for its fourth APAC value-add fund which included data centres as one of its primary targets for acquisitions, after the fund manager had made earlier ventures in the sector in the US and Europe.\n\nUnder the deal, PGIM will maintain an 80 percent stake in the JV and Equinix will own the remaining 20 percent interest, a similar structure to the data centre provider’s earlier deals with GIC. The Prudential affiliate is expected to provide market insight and support to the JV using its background in local real estate equity and debt markets.\n\nEquinix said the planned facilities are aimed at serving core workload deployment requirements of hyperscale companies including the world’s biggest cloud service providers. Among the Nasdaq-listed company’s existing clients are Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, according to Equinix.\n\nGlobal Ambitions\n\nThe JV is expected to close within this quarter after obtaining regulatory approvals for SY9x and SY10x, as the proposed facilities have been dubbed, with the first hyperscale project expected to open in the first quarter of next year.\n\nWith the Sydney plan signed, the two companies may have opportunities to work together beyond Australia’s borders, according to PGIM.\n\n“We are extremely pleased to partner with Equinix on this investment in Sydney, and we look forward to expanding this strategic relationship in other markets, thereby providing our investors further access to the increasingly important digital infrastructure sector,” Eric Adler, chief executive officer of PGIM Real Estate said in a release on Tuesday.\n\nEquinix currently has six xScale data centres operating globally with one each in Tokyo and Sao Paolo, plus paired projects in Paris and London.\n\nAussie Potential\n\nWhile the venture is the first to bring Equinix’ supersized facilities to Australia, the company has already established 17 of its smaller International Business Exchange data centres in the country, with that number expected to grow to 18 by year’s end upon the completion of its PE3 facility in Perth.\n\nNow with cloud computing and the mobile Internet booming, Equinix and PGIM are betting that hyperscale data centres, where a single client leases 10MW of capacity or more represent the future of demand.\n\n“The world’s largest hyperscalers have partnered with Equinix for many years to leverage our global platform to directly connect with their business partners and customers, said Paul Dwyer, Equinix’ senior director for xScale development for Asia Pacific. “These hyperscalers are looking for certainty and further access to the important digital infrastructure necessary to meet accelerating customer demand and our partnership with PGIM recognises the market opportunity to support their expansion and serve their unique deployment needs.”\n\nThe hyperscale colocation market in Sydney and Melbourne is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22 percent from 2021 through 2026 in terms of built-out power capacity, accord to data centre consulting firm Structure Research.\n\n“Australia is set to build out its next wave of capacity, with the hyperscale market expected to grow about double the rate of the retail segment by 2026,” said Jabez Tan, head of research at Structure Research. “There have been unprecedented levels of cloud adoption in the country.”\n\nPartners for Progress\n\nFor Equinix the agreement with PGIM provides it with an additional capital partner after earlier establishing a relationship with GIC which powered the opening of the firm’s first Asian hyperscale facility, TY12x, in Tokyo during March of this year.\n\nThat opening came after the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund formed a $1 billion joint venture with Equinix in April of last year. Then in June of this year, GIC said it would invest another $3.9 billion with Equinix with the goal of building a total of 32 hyperscale facilities globally.\n\nIn mid-2019 Equinix and GIC had signed a $1 billion joint venture deal to build and operate data centres in Europe.",

    title: "The VaynerMedia Go-To-Market Strategy Blueprint for APAC expansion",
    text: "Pursuing a “land and expand” strategy, VaynerMedia officially launched an office in Singapore around April 2019, roughly 18 months after Gary Vaynerchuk first spoke about opening a location in the APAC region while adding that Singapore would be the headquarters.\n\nAvery Akkineni, VP of Global Media Operations at VaynerMedia, spoke to Branding In Asia about the go-to-market (GTM) strategy deployed by the full-service digital agency, which identified the APAC market was in dire need of an agile, integrated, and independent marketing agency.\n\nShe said that VaynerMedia views Asia as a hyper-growth market which already includes a presence of many of the existing client partners of the agency. As an independent agency, she said that VaynerMedia is focused solely on providing value to brands instead of operating like publicly listing global holdings companies that are fixated on hitting their own quarterly agency profit margins.\n\n“Since our soft launch earlier this year, we’ve taken on about a dozen initial clients in Asia; across the CPG, entertainment, telecom, and personal care verticals,” said Akkineni. “We are covering both regional campaigns, and campaigns specific to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, etc. By the end of the year, we’re on track to expand our service offerings and team to accommodate client opportunities across creative, strategy, and media.”\n\nIn Singapore, the agency focused its attention on hiring a mix of key local and regional talent to join a few transplants from the London and New York offices of VaynerMedia. Akkineni said that the agency has already on-boarded Singapore team members locally and from Malaysia and Hong Kong as well while looking forward to bringing on additional local expertise.\n\nAwareness – 2017\n\nGary Vaynerchuk visited the region with the Rise conference in Hong Kong and Brand Minds Asia in Singapore. At each event, he was interviewed by both consumer and business press, dropping hints at launching a regional office, and offering commentary pertaining to the APAC region, primarily stirring the pot.\n\nConsideration – 2017/2018\n\nDuring each visit, Vaynerchuk met with prospects across advertisers, channel partners, and collaborators, while taking discussions further with global marketing clients and prospects. He concluded each visit by developing a strategic platform formed with agency partnerships while highlighting top global and local work to prospective partners. Branding In Asia has learned that senior leaders of VaynerMedia also met prospective client and agency partners in the MENA region, specifically in Dubai, the UAE. For both the APAC and MENA regions, these visits were meant to gauge the appetite of the markets and initiate partnership discussions.\n\nConversions – 2018/2019\n\nFollowing a soft launch, VaynerMedia proceeded to on-board key initial clients in the APAC region, establishing the foundations of the Singapore operations. This included deepening key relationships with brand partners, recommending approaches to client challenges (through RFPs and campaign execution), and proving the value of VaynerMedia through initial partnerships. By the second half of 2019, Akkineni expects that the agency will officially launch with key partners.",

This approach modernizes the traditionally manual and tedious construction materials purchasing process. “Our platform is designed to help hardware store owners compare prices and products efficiently and online, making their buying process much faster and simpler,” says Lafaurie.\n\nIn its first year under this new marketplace model, TUL aims to partner with over 300 distributors and serve around 10,000 customers each month. This endeavor represents a significant step forward in the company’s growth, focusing on enhancing customer experience and expanding its reach in the competitive Latin American market.\n\nWith this evolution, TUL seeks to strengthen its position in the construction materials market and aspires to be a catalyst in transforming the construction supply chain in Latin America. Its commitment to continuous improvement and innovation makes a notable difference, offering customers a more efficient, accessible, and modern way to acquire the materials needed for their construction projects.",

    text: "Luzia, the emerging startup from Spain and pioneer in deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) based assistants, has secured significant funding of EUR €9.5 million. With this capital, the company aims to strengthen its position in the dynamic AI-based technology market in Latin America and other regions globally.\n\nThe firm, known for its AI assistant, widely used on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, has successfully concluded its third funding round in less than six months, marking its most significant capital influx. Several investors have shown interest in Luzia, notably Gasol16 Ventures, led by the renowned Pau Gasol and Khosla Ventures. This US-based entity has backed giants like Stripe and innovative projects like Worldcoin, an initiative from Sam Altman known for ChatGPT.\n\nLuzia’s goal with these funds is to explore new frontiers and bolster its team of specialists based in Spain. With a user base of 17 million and a staggering figure of 880 million questions managed, Luzia’s assistant transcribes audio into text and generates images.\n\nTheir efforts are centered in Spain and critical Latin American territories such as Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia.

Joining him in this journey with Luzia are Javier Andrés, the brain behind Ticketea, and Carlos Pérez, an entrepreneur who has led companies like Eventid and Devaway to success, later acquired by Ticketea and Jobandtalent, respectively.\n\nLastly, it’s vital to underscore that Luzia is a testament to AI’s rapid growth and enthusiasm in Spain’s startup sector. According to recent sources, one out of every four new companies in the country has already integrated AI into their operations and services.\n\nAccording to the projections from analytics firm IDC, as seen here, organizations are expected to invest more than USD $150 billion in AI-based systems in 2023, marking a 26.9% increase compared to 2022. By 2026, the total investment in AI will surpass USD $300 billion in just three years.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, according to a survey conducted by Ipsos, countries like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia have a high acceptance of using Artificial Intelligence among their citizens, undoubtedly representing a market of immense interest and value for companies like Luzia.",

A significant milestone for Colombia, in particular, is the planned investment of over USD $100 million in the country’s first cloud data center, with its inauguration scheduled for the first week of December.\n\nGustavo Mousalli, Vice President of Oracle for Latin America, commented on the impact of AI on job creation, highlighting that the opening of the data center will generate numerous direct and indirect jobs, becoming a hub for the company’s AI services.\n\n“People talk a lot about how AI is going to take away many jobs, but if we are opening a data center, we are going to generate many direct and indirect jobs, and it is from this center that all the AI services will emerge.”\n\nThe Future of NetSuite\n\nNetSuite has specific plans to promote jobs in regions and among youth and women, indicating an inclusive and diverse approach in its expansion strategy. Similarly, the availability of a Colombian location for its current and future clients operating in Colombia or requiring to manage operations in multiple countries, languages, or currencies was also announced. This is part of its effort to adapt its software to the specific tax regulations of each country.\n\nNetSuite offers services to businesses of all sizes and sectors, with more than 37,000 clients globally, proving to be a valuable tool for NGOs by aiding them in optimizing and bringing transparency to their processes through its robust data analysis and processing tools.\n\nFor startups, NetSuite has become a key ally. An example is Tul, a hardware-specialized app founded during the pandemic that is now operating in Mexico and Brazil. Juan Carlos de la Cruz, product manager of Tul, highlighted NetSuite’s flexibility and versatility, especially in challenging times, providing real-time information and facilitating the integration of accounting movements.\n\n“NetSuite allows us flexibility in our growth and versatility in difficult times. Thanks to NetSuite, we are faster, have real-time information in one place, and it has also enabled the integration of all accounting movements,” stated Juan Carlos de la Cruz.\n\n\n\nLastly, it was emphasized that NetSuite can serve small and medium-sized businesses to large corporations, covering a wide range of business needs. In this context, startups are beginning to recognize and value these solutions, anticipating greater adoption in the near future",

    title: "LATAM Cargo expands its intercontinental reach",
    text: "Latin America’s largest airline, LATAM Cargo, is boosting its intercontinental reach.\n\nHaving launched flights from São Paulo to Boston in early July (its second new US route from its Brazilian hub opened in eight months), LATAM Airlines has set its sights on transatlantic expansion.\n\nIt plans to start services to Lisbon in September, followed by flights to Tel Aviv three months later – the only direct route between Latin America and Israel. In the first half of next year management intends to add Munich to the network.\n\nAndrés Bianchi, CEO of LATAM Cargo, is looking forward to the new routes. Outbound they will further enhance the capacity that the carrier provides to exporters from the region.\n\nIn the opposite direction the cargo division is working on building feeder networks to the new stations, he says. Above all, Munich should offer good access to the industrial centres in southern Germany.\n\nLATAM’s international expansion has been hampered by the problems of Rolls-Royce engines on the 787-9s. “We were probably one of the hardest hit companies. About half of our 787 fleet was grounded at some point,” remarks Bianchi.\n\nLATAM has some more 787s on order as well as A350-1000s. “We’re looking for growth in our widebody capacity,” he says.\n\nThe airline’s freighter fleet has also seen some change. Earlier this year it sold is remaining two B777-200 cargo planes to Atlas Air.\n\nThe 777s – ordered at a time when Latin America was booming and before the merger with TAM, which brought in a lot of belly capacity – were meant for Europe and trunk routes in Latin America but are not well suited to multi-stop routings.\n\nThe 767, historically the backbone of the freighter fleet, is better suited to the airline’s core markets and eight hour segments, according to Bianchi.\n\nHe has been unequivocal on the importance of freighters in the airline’s business, calling them ‘an integral part of LATAM’s cargo proposition’.\n\nThe departure of the final two 777 freighters does not reduce the carrier’s freighter capacity, as it is adding more 767-300 cargo aircraft to its line-up. It took delivery of one in May and is adding three more by converting passenger aircraft from its own fleet into all-cargo configuration.\n\nThe first of these is due to enter service in November, and one each is to come on stream in 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe unit due in November will be used to cut back on LATAM’s use of ACMI capacity, but the following two are earmarked for expansion. These shifts will bring the freighter fleet to 12 units.\n\nThe withdrawal of the last 777F prompted a reshuffle of the carrier’s transatlantic freighter schedule. In lieu of three weekly 777 flights to Europe, it now operates five weekly frequencies with 767s, which is roughly the same capacity in terms of ATKs (available tonne-kilometres) Bianchi notes.\n\nAt the same time, LATAM Cargo shifted the routing and is now serving Madrid and Brussels.\n\n“We took advantage of the higher flexibility to open Madrid. Brussels had a lot to do with the constraints in Amsterdam,” says Bianchi. The results have been better than expected, he adds.\n\nIn the Americas LATAM made one change to the freighter operation this year, adding Antofagasta in northern Chile to the network with twice weekly flights from Miami that continue to Santiago. The airport is an important gateway to supply mining activities in the region.\n\nAt this point some potential destinations are under review, but no major additions or changes are on the agenda. “By and large we are keeping the same network,” says Bianchi.\n\nBuoyed by the recovery in its home region, LATAM Cargo has been on a roll. After a contraction in 2016, owing to a depressed market (particularly Brazil, the largest economy in its region), cargo revenues climbed again last year, up 6.7 per cent over the previous year.\n\nThe momentum held in the first quarter, which saw a 16.6 per cent rise in cargo revenues to $295.8 million. Yields advanced 7.1 per cent in the period, while the load factor was up 1.9 per cent points.\n\nAccording to Bianchi, these numbers are a better reflection of the carrier’s progress than the 2017 results. “Last year we were phasing out the 777s and readjusting. Now it is more like comparing apples to apples,” he remarks.\n\nThe second quarter was less buoyant. Outbound flows were still going well, but on the inbound side traffic ‘cooled off a bit’, which Bianchi attributes in part to the truck strike in Brazil. Political uncertainty in parts of the region, such as upcoming elections in Brazil, have also been a factor, he adds.\n\nOn the whole he is optimistic about the remainder of 2018, notwithstanding question marks over barriers to trade. “We are looking for a good second half of the year,” Bianchi says.\n\n“We are all in wait-and-see mode to see how flows will be affected by trade wars and how goods will move around. Otherwise, I believe there will be a continuation of what we have seen so far.”\n\nPerishables, which dominate outbound flows from Latin America, have been doing well. China’s growing appetite for fruits, vegetables and other types of food has been a significant driver.\n\nLATAM has no direct flights to this market, so the cultivation of interline relationships with transpacific carriers has been a key plank in the cargo division’s strategy.\n\n“We need connectivity to a growing Asian market as part of our value proposition as the leading carrier in and out of Latin America,” comments Bianchi. “We will boost the quality and quantity of our interline partners.”\n\nOne possible avenue to develop in that arena is the relationship with American Airlines, which is set to become a good deal closer in the wake of an open skies agreement between Brazil and the US.\n\nThe Brazilian authorities have given their blessing, but the US government has yet to ratify it. Open skies has been a prerequisite for antitrust immunity for a proposed joint venture between the two carriers.\n\nTo date there has not been any exchange of ideas with AA Cargo management on this issue. To open this discussion, antitrust immunity has to be in place first, Bianchi remarks.\n\nThe joint venture project is driven by the passenger business, but he sees a lot of potential on the cargo side – to provide new routes, better connections and better solutions for LATAM’s customers.\n\n“This will open up new alternatives for our cargo customers. We can build better solutions for our customers with our partners,” he says.\n\nTwo years ago LATAM Cargo embarked on a revamp of its product portfolio. A key objective in this was to offer more flexibility and provide customers with more choice, a broader spectrum between high value and more cost effective solutions.\n\nThe results so far have been encouraging but work on the value proposition is by no means complete, Bianchi stresses.\n\nBetter flow of information, improved tracking as well as operational support in connecting markets are on his agenda there, and so are further improvements in the cold chain.\n\nLast year LATAM obtained CEIV certification, the first airline in the Americas to achieve this accreditation.\n\nOne critical piece in the puzzle for Bianchi is an overhaul of his company’s IT infrastructure from a multitude of systems into a single platform. In June LATAM announced that it had picked India-based Wipro to provide it with a cloud-based next-generation system.\n\nBianchi describes the current set up as a complicated and diverse landscape of legacy systems built piece by piece over time. “We have integration issues with systems. We are slower and have a forced silo strategy,” he says.\n\nAccording to him, the new system will transform both LATAM’s internal operations and the way how it interacts with its clientele.\n\nFor the airline’s customers it will usher in a new tracking system and a range of self-service tools such as e-booking, e-claims and e-rates.\n\nAs many as 45 employees will be dedicated exclusively to the execution of the project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2020. The first stage will cover international markets.\n\nOn the ground, airport infrastructure and the impact of passenger-related construction are issues – as are slot restrictions in some overseas gateways.\n\nThe developments in Frankfurt and Amsterdam have been a concern, as are constraints at Lima, which prompted the airline to signal earlier this year that it would not launch any new international flights from the Peruvian capital for the time being owing to the saturation of the airport.\n\nLima is planning a second runway and a new passenger terminal.\n\nMeanwhile, Santiago is going through an expansion, while São Paulo’s Guarulhos Airport recently completed a major renovation project. “There is still work to be done on our three main hubs,” Bianchi says.\n\nHe also intends to spend more effort on the product portfolio. The overhaul so far has concentrated chiefly on the international sector, now the focus is shifting to domestic services, notably a door-to-door network in Brazil.\n\nA single solution will not suffice there. In some markets B2C traffic is going strong, in others the focus is more on the B2B segment.",

BMLL now offers a range of Level 2 or Level 3 data across the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\n\n“We said it [China trading data] was unique and six months into it, clients are using that data that they can’t get anywhere else in that format,” said Humphrey. “There is a route where members can go directly to the exchange together for depth of course but that’s in raw format and that requires heavy lifting that really only a handful of firms in the world can actually perform.”\n\n\n\nRead more – BMLL completes China equity data offering with the addition of Shanghai data\n\nThe firm now offers data across venues in Europe, North America, South Africa and Asia Pacific including China, India, Singapore, Australia, and Japan.\n\nBMLL buys the historic data in raw format from the source and then goes through the process of harmonising it on behalf of its clients.\n\n“Our clients can see in the raw format so they know that we haven’t lost any of the data attributes, but we also present it in a consistent and normalised way without losing any of its attributes,” added Humphrey. “I continue to read comments about data reliability and consistency and that cleaning data almost certainly results in the degradation of data quality.”\n\n“We buy our historic data from source – that’s a starting point direct from the matching engine or partner collects it for us. The less you start from this point, the less you can you hope to provide historical data with only minimal errors. We preserve all the row fields from the original data but we also have a normalised layer for managing trade condition codes, market states across multiple markets and regions.”",

    title: "LatAm fintech unicorn Ebanx expands into Africa's payment market",
    text: 'EBANX, a global payments fintech company founded in Latin America is expanding its operations and payments solutions outside Latin America for the first time.\n\nAfter growing its footprint to 15 Latin American countries for more than a decade, EBANX has prioritized global expansion on the African continent, which it believes is the next big growth frontier for digital payments and the digital market during the 2020s.\n\nThe fintech unicorn disclosed this during the sixth edition of the annual Latin America Summit powered by EBANX in Mexico City on Tuesday (September 13, 2022).\n\n"This is the moment for Africa, and it’s quite reminiscent of the Latin American landscape back in 2012 when EBANX first began its journey by providing global merchants access to sell more goods and digital services via the internet to Latin Americans through local payment methods," João Del Valle, CEO and co-founder of EBANX, said in a statement seen by Benjamindada.com\n\nAfrica’s fast-growing digital economy is only in its early days, and it’s projected to grow up and to the right for the next few decades. Together with local players, EBANX will be a catalyst to realize the many benefits of a digital economy even faster. - João Del Valle\n\nAccording to a June 2022 report released by Endeavor with contributions from McKinsey & Company, there\'s currently a $115 billion digital economy in Africa, the result of a combination of young and digitally savvy population, increasing digital penetration, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen it comes to the digital games market, the Africa region is the fastest-growing one in the world, according to Newzoo. It is currently a $2.6 billion market, scaling 5 times faster than the global average in 2022, and expected to grow at almost 10% per year through 2026. The streaming market in Africa, of currently $1.9 billion, is expected to accelerate even faster, at 14% per year through 2026.\n\nEbanx will be competing with African fintech companies like Flutterwave, Yoco, Paystack, MFS Africa, and OPay, which are currently in the continent\'s payment market.\n\nAccording to Paula Bellizia, President of Global Payments at EBANX, "Africa is now bursting with growth potential. Digital adoption and consumption of online goods and services have accelerated rapidly within its countries, and investment capital has been pouring into the region."\n\n"After studying the region and building a deep understanding of its local players, entities, and challenges, we are diving into Africa to provide local payments solutions that will help build the digital economy at a rapid pace, drive broader financial inclusion for its population, and provide greater access to a variety of goods and services from global merchants interested in building their market share there," Belliza added.\n\nAccording to Endeavor’s report, together with Egypt, the three African countries EBANX is focusing on first (South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria) account for 32% of the continent’s population, 51% of its GDP, and 73% of the startup accelerators active in Africa today. Africa’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2010 to 2019 was higher than in both Europe and Latin America.\n\nImportantly, a high level of mobile penetration and consumption in African countries positions the region to be the "next frontier" – but while increasing mobile access help boost online shopping in LatAm during the later stages of digital inclusion, in Africa, mobile devices and digital money transfers are the foundation for banking access and financial inclusion for the continent’s massive population of more than 1 billion people.\n\nPipefy, a powerful SaaS low-code platform for workflow management founded in 2015 in Latin America and operating within over 200 countries worldwide, is present in the Africa region with EBANX as its payments partner. "Expanding our solutions to African countries speaks directly to EBANX\'s mission of creating access, and having Pipefy as a merchant makes this moment even more special to us, expanding solutions and services throughout regions full of opportunities," Bellizia said.\n\nHow Ebanx\'s pan-African expansion will work.\n\nAccording to a statement, the LatAm unicorn disclosed that its solutions in the African region will contemplate popular local payment methods such as: Instant EFT by OZOW in South Africa; the payment method allows line shoppers to access internet banking to make an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) that gets instantly verified. EFT is the second most popular online payment method in South Africa today.\n\nIn Kenya, Ebanx will sample M-Pesa, a mobile banking service that lets users store and transfer money, as well as pay for online shopping through their mobile phones. M-Pesa was introduced in Kenya as an alternative way for the country’s population to have access to financial services.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nigeria, the company disclosed that it will experiment with the following payment methods: USSD—a session-based protocol that travels over the GSM signalling channel to query information and trigger services. It enables customers to pay for their e-commerce shopping—and Bank Transfers, which enable customers to pay for online purchases quickly and easily without needing a credit or debit card. They are one of Nigeria’s leading alternative payment methods because they are very secure and reliable.',

    title: "LatAm fintech, Ebanx expands into eight African countries",
    text: "EBANX has expanded into eight African countries: Ivory Coast, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. The LatAm fintech unicorn is now present in eleven African markets.\n\nA year after its African debut in three markets—South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya, EBANX, a global technology company specialising in payments for emerging markets, has expanded into Ivory Coast, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.\n\nThis was disclosed during the seventh edition of the fintech's Payments Summit , held from September 18 to 20 in São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nAccording to Paula Bellizia, President of Global Payments at EBANX, \"This expansion reinforces our global reach and local depth, our commitment to rising markets and our merchants, and EBANX's mission to create access. Through technology and local payments, we now connect nearly 1 billion people who are digital buyers from 29 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, three rapidly growing digital regions, to the world's largest brands.\"\n\nWith this expansion, EBANX consolidates its coverage in the African continent, extending its footprint to 11 countries, including Northern, Western, East, and Southern Africa.\n\n🌍 In April, EBANX hired Wiza Jalakasi , the former VP of global merchant payments at Chipper Cash, to lead its African operations\n\nIn addition to Africa, the fintech also announced during the summit the advancement of its expansion throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, with the addition of the Bahamas and Jamaica to its portfolio, reaching 17 Latin American countries, and 29 worldwide, including the recent addition of India .\n\nPaula Bellizia, President of Global Payments at EBANX.\n\nThe next digital frontiers in Africa\n\nThe African continent holds significant potential for digital commerce growth: it is expected that the rate of online shoppers in the region will increase by 10% annually until 2027, according to Insider Intelligence, in a population that exceeds one billion people. At the same time, only 15% of Africans made an online purchase, according to data from the World Bank, indicating an emerging market that is poised for acceleration.\n\nThe high penetration of mobile phones has been the foundation for financial inclusion and digital payments: 83% of the population has a mobile subscription, and 75% of internet traffic in the region is conducted through mobile phones, according to World Bank data. This reality is driving the adoption of digital payments: 46% of African adults have already made at least one digital payment, a significant increase in less than eight years when penetration was only 23%.\n\nCoupled with telecommunications infrastructure, these factors have created the highest mobile money penetration in the world: Africa is responsible for nearly 70% of the total volume transacted through mobile money globally and over half of its users. In Kenya, for example, where EBANX has been operating since September 2022, almost 70% of the population has a mobile money account, according to World Bank data and EBANX's calculations .\n\n\"The significant mobile phone penetration, low cost of mobile data, and an acceleration of digital services are also positioning countries like Tanzania, Ghana, Uganda, and Zambia among the 'next digital frontiers of Africa', to name just a few, that are expected to become the next growth hubs for digital companies,\" said Andre Allain, VP of Partnerships and Market Development at EBANX.\n\nEBANX begins its operations in these countries, in addition to Ivory Coast and Senegal, with mobile money, connecting global merchants to this local payment method. In Egypt and Morocco, the fintech starts its operations with cash-based methods, the most commonly used in digital commerce.\n\nEgypt, the second-largest economy in Africa, has mobile phone and internet penetration rates above average. At the same time, 73% of Egyptians are unbanked, and only 3% of them have a credit card, according to the World Bank Global Findex 2021. Morocco has the highest internet penetration in the region, reaching 90%, according to Euromonitor, and a growing use of mobile phones, creating a fruitful environment for digital commerce to flourish – a market expected to reach USD 5 billion in volume by the end of this year, according to Statista Market Insights.\n\n\"With a footprint of 11 markets in Africa, EBANX consolidates its presence in the region, in markets with immense potential that are experiencing remarkable economic growth and increasing digital services penetration. We are committed to continuously improving our services and connecting global brands with all ecosystems, helping merchants approach the whole continent with specific payment strategies for each country,\" said Allain.\n\nThe Caribbean, a region naturally inclined towards cross-border commerce\n\nEBANX's expansion into the Bahamas and Jamaica complements the fintech's movement into Central America and the Caribbean, which began in 2021 with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. It also reflects a moment of consolidation in the Caribbean digital market: cross-border commerce dominates the region, accounting for 80% of online sales. The proximity to the United States and a history of tourist traffic contribute to familiarity with global brands and, consequently to this acceleration.\n\nIn terms of the most commonly used payment methods, there is a strong presence of cards in online sales in the Bahamas and Jamaica, with debit cards accounting for over 30% of digital commerce volume, according to data from Americas Market Intelligence - AMI, and where online sales are expected to accelerate at double-digit annual rates by 2027. Following this scenario, EBANX launches its operations initially covering these payment methods.\n\n\"Looking at the Central America and Caribbean region in an integrated way, considering all its economic strengths, and offering the preferred local payment methods from each country is essential for global merchants to fully tap into the potential of this region,\" completed Allain.",

    text: "Qatar Airways has signed an expanded codeshare agreement with LATAM Airlines Brasil that will see its code placed on 45 additional LATAM Airlines Brasil flights enhancing connectivity across Brazil to and from destinations such as Curitiba, Manaus, Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Luiz & Vitoria\n\nLATAM Airlines Brasil will also be adding its code on Qatar Airways’ recently expanded 10 weekly flights to and from São Paulo , as well as on flights to several additional destinations beyond Doha, including Bangkok*, Hong Kong*, Maldives, Nairobi, Seoul* and Tokyo*\n\nQatar Airways is pleased to announce it has increased São Paulo services to 10 weekly flights and expanded codeshare cooperation with LATAM Airlines Brasil optimising connectivity for both airline’s passengers to and from destinations in Asia, the Middle East and South America. The new codeshare agreement will further strengthen the two airlines’ strategic partnership, first initiated in 2016 and recently expanded in June 2019.\n\nThe expanded agreement will allow Qatar Airways passengers to book travel on 45 additional LATAM Airlines Brasil flights and to access over 40 domestic and international destinations on the South American carrier’s network, including Brasilia, Curitiba, Porto Velho, Rio Branco, Rio de Janeiro, San Jose, Lima (Peru), Montevido (Uruguay) and Santiago (Chile).\n\nLATAM Airlines Brasil passengers will also benefit from access to the recently expanded 10 weekly flights to and from Sao Paulo, operated by Qatar Airways’ state-of-the-art Airbus A350-1000 that features the World’s Best Business Class Seat, Qsuite. LATAM Airlines Brasil passengers will also be able to book travel to eight additional Qatar Airways’ destinations such as Bangkok*, Hong Kong*, Maldives, Nairobi, Seoul* and Tokyo* along with additional Qatar Airways’ connecting flights to destinations such as Baku, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.\n\nWith an existing loyalty cooperation, frequent fliers with both airlines are also able to earn and redeem miles for travel across the partners’ complete network as well as recognition of their tier status at select airports with benefits such as priority check-in and priority boarding.\n\nQatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, said: “South America is a strategically important market for Qatar Airways. We are proud to demonstrate our strong commitment to passengers travelling to and from South America by providing even more flexible travel options.

      "All in good time: Caudalie prioritising APAC expansion plans in India and Vietnam",
    text: "The brand was established in 1995 and is still privately owned by its co-founders, Mathilde and Bertrand Thomas. Today, Caudalie is best known for its vinotherapy skin care products, inspired by the family’s vineyard in Bordeaux, France.\n\nThis year, the company expects the brand to grow by around 15% to 20% in its existing markets in SEA, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n“We have ambitious growth plans but we’re not expanding the distribution; in fact, we are mostly exclusive to Sephora for these markets. We will invest and continue to build the brand around us, build a community of fans, and just make sure that the customer knows we are there,” ​said Jean-Christophe Samyn, general manager, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSpeaking to CosmeticsDesign-Asia​, Samyn said that in addition to reinforcing its position in these existing markets, Caudalie has been busy widening its footprint in the region.\n\nIt recently relaunched the brand in Indonesia with e-commerce players Shopee and Lazada, and entered new markets, India and Vietnam.\n\n“India is definitely a big priority. I don’t know if it’s the next China, but there’s definitely a lot of exciting news coming from there. The retail landscape is fast-moving at the moment. There are a lot of interesting new brands arriving on the market as well. It's a good time to be part of that,” ​said Samyn.\n\n“Vietnam is potentially a big market and I think it’s an interesting market. It’s not new, it’s been dominated by a lot of very premium brands for a long time. The market is still very much split into the very premium brands and the mass brands. That middle segment is not quite there yet, and that’s where we belong.”​\n\nThe brand is pursuing an omnichannel strategy for both markets, launching in both the brick-and-mortar space with department stores and online with e-commerce players like Nykaa and Shopee.\n\n“These two markets are the big priorities for us this year and next year. We’re quite careful about where we want to go and we’re taking the time to really plant our seeds when we do so. Rather than opening in every market, we choose carefully,” ​said Samyn.\n\n‘It just works’​\n\nDespite the troubles of the past couple of years, the brand has been doing well.\n\nLast year, in its home market, the brand grew around 5% – its best growth in a decade. In the US, it finished the year up 25%. Across South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand, there was high single-digit growth, nearly 10%.\n\nThe brand’s success could be attributed to the ever-increasing demand for clean beauty products, which had accelerated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. But more than its clean status, Caudalie’s products are effective, Samyn said.\n\n“There’s a reason why our number one product [Vinoperfect Radiance Serum Complexion Correcting] has 35% market share in French pharmacies – it just works… We have all these testimonials from women who tell us that our products have worked for them – we call it our honesty campaign.​\n\n“A lot of people have realised that it’s not a choice between an effective brand and a clean brand. It’s not about choosing one or the other.\"​",

    text: "In recent years, the company has expanded @cosme’s presence in several APAC countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and China.\n\nExpanding further into China\n\nMost recently, the company launched an official flagship store on Tmall specifically for the domestic China market, to capitalise on general trade sales in the country.\n\nPrior to this, it conducted cross-border e-commerce sales to China through its official international flagship store on Tmall\n\nSenior vice president Hajime Endo said the new ‘general trade’ flagship store minimised the risk of being impacted by China’s constantly changing e-commerce laws.\n\n“Although the postponement of the implementation of new cross-border e-commerce regulations… has been extended indefinitely beyond 2019, risks remain with regard to compliance with the new regulations once they come into force.​\n\n“By leveraging its e-commerce experience accrued from its domestic and international operations to set up cross-border e-commerce stores as well as general trade e-commerce stores within China, istyle aims to provide comprehensive support and become a stable and powerful platform for cosmetics brands’ access to China.”​\n\nThe move brings istyle a step closer to the possibility of opening a brick-and-mortar store in China, said Endo.\n\nPopularity of J-beauty rising in APAC\n\nThe accelerated expansion of @cosme in the last few years is driven by rising demand for Japanese beauty products in APAC.\n\nHe believes this trend is driven largely by the Internet and its ability to spread awareness on a global scale.\n\nFor instance, the popularity of @cosme’s affiliated ranking and review website is arguably one of the most influential beauty websites in Asia, even though it started out targeting Japanese beauty consumers.\n\nEndo said APAC consumers continue to seek Japanese-made beauty products because it is associated with safety and quality.\n\n“APAC consumers trust Japanese cosmetic products because of the safety. They trust in the quality and how that quality is maintained.”​\n\nHe added that Japanese products also fulfilled consumers’ demand for more functional products.\n\n“In Japan, consumers spend more on cosmetics and Japanese cosmetic companies try to create products that have high-functionality. So they are known for function because Japanese companies have been creating such products for longer. ​\n\nEndo highlighted that increasing consumption of Japanese beauty products in APAC is influenced by the change in buying power.\n\n“Before, consumers were buying daily necessities and their motivations were hygiene-focused. Today, they want to buy more luxury products and products are bought for beauty and vanity reasons.”​\n\nEndo believes that there are many Japanese brands have not been fully exposed in APAC, creating opportunities for growth.\n\n“Right now, Korean brands have more awareness in the market. Japanese brands have not approached the overseas markets that much in previous years. I would say they have only just started to look into markets abroad.”​\n\nEyeing ASEAN expansion\n\nEndo said the company is very interested in expanding to more countries in the ASEAN region.\n\nLast November, the company launched its first @cosme store in Thailand and has already opened its second branch in February.\n\nIt already has an e-commerce presence in Malaysia but hopes to expand there as well as in Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore.\n\nHowever, Endo said these plans may change due to the rapidly changing trends in the cosmetics market.\n\n“Information is moving very fast because of the Internet. I cannot say what will happen in five years. We will observe and see where the demand is and will choose our market based on that.”​",

      "Unexpected rise in demand sees LATAM plan huge expansion of freighter fleet",
    text: "Latin America’s largest cargo carrier is going for a massive expansion of its freighter fleet.\n\nOver the next three years, LATAM Cargo will add up to eight 767-300ER converted freighter aircraft to its line-up.\n\nIn a deal with Boeing announced this week, the airline will have four 767-300s converted into all-cargo configuration by next year, and it has signed up for four more options, slated to enter service in 2023.\n\n“If we take all eight, which we are likely going to do, it is the largest expansion of the freighter fleet in our history,” said LATAM Cargo CEO Andrés Bianchi.\n\nLATAM currently has 11 B767 freighters in service and the full expansion would bring its fleet to 19 B767 all-cargo planes, an increase of 80%.\n\nThe first four aircraft will chiefly reinforce the carrier’s current network, strengthening its intra-American routes, including some domestic sectors where e-commerce has been going strong.\n\nTransatlantic capacity will see some increase, and management is also interested in boosting its footprint in the US, currently just Miami as far as freighter operations are concerned. A possible scenario is a resumption of freighter services to Chicago, a major route for interline traffic to and from Asia that was suspended in the wake of Covid-induced cutbacks.\n\nStronger-than-anticipated demand has been one factor behind the decision to expand the freighter fleet earlier than planned. Outbound traffic to North America and Europe has remained robust, although exports to Asia have taken a hit over the past year.\n\nInbound volumes, critical because of the higher yields they typically generate, have been a positive surprise, developing stronger than projected, Mr Bianchi said. Behind this has been the rise of e-commerce flows from Asia, Europe and North America to the region, which is expected to continue.\n\nThis is another reason for the freighter fleet expansion, as the 767 is well suited to carrying this traffic, he added.\n\nWhile import volumes have fallen short of pre-pandemic levels, yields have been strengthened by the shortage of belly capacity. LATAM’s own international passenger operations were recovering at a good clip last year, but were hit by the second wave of Covid-19 in Latin America, which forced the suspension of some routes, Mr Bianchi said.\n\nAvianca, the region’s second-largest cargo carrier, announced on 1 March it would suspend 24 international routes, including service from Bogota to Los Angeles, Washington, London and Barcelona, and from Medellin and Cali to Madrid.\n\nLATAM tries to compensate for lost cargo capacity when passenger routes are suspended. The airline has operated a large number of cargo missions with passenger equipment, and at the height of the rush to bring PPE shipments to Latin America, up to 70% of its widebody passenger planes were used.\n\nThe economics of running these cargo flights with passenger widebodies are more challenging than using freighters. Moreover, yields in Latin America have not been as strong as on routes from Asia to Europe and North America, as the perishables that make up the bulk of Latin American exports cannot absorb such large rate increases.\n\n“We review the performance of every passenger freighter flight we do,” Mr Bianchi said. “A lot are pretty marginal, from a results perspective, but we keep them flying because we understand that, for our customers, it’s critical. We view this as kind of support to key industries to keep them flying, kind of an investment to keep those industries going.”\n\nDiminished passenger traffic has a silver lining, in as much as it frees-up 767s earlier than anticipated and these are good candidates for conversion, having been selected at the time of purchase with future use for cargo in mind. The airframes and engines are well suited for their second role in the LATAM fleet, Mr Bianchi exxplained.\n\nThe 80% boost to the cargo line-up is a strong signal to the market that LATAM’s freighter fleet is here to stay, he said. When the airline sold its four 777-200 freighters, it raised questions about a possible withdrawal from all-cargo operations, he recalled.\n\n“We let the 777 go because it does not fit our network,” he said. “The 767 does fit – we can push it on the longhaul side and, if needed, it can also be deployed in domestic markets.”",

    text: "Fintech unicorn Airwallex has agreed to acquire MexPago, a payment service provider based in Mexico, as it continues its expansion through Latin America.\n\nFounded in 2014, MexPago empowers merchants to accept various modern payment methods using a single payments platform – from receiving payments on major card networks like Visa and Mastercard to conducting SPEI interbank transfers for online or physical stores. It holds an Institution of Electronic Payment Funds (IFPE) licence, which will allow Airwallex to expand its financial infrastructure into the region.\n\n\n\nAhead of today’s announcement, Airwallex had already reported year-on-year growth in the Americas of more than 400%. The company has been a unicorn since 2019 and, this time last year, was topping up its valuation to US$5.5bn thanks to a US$100m extension of its Series E round.\n\n\n\nAirwallex enters Latin America with MexPago deal\n\nRavi Adusumilli, Executive General Manager for the Americas at Airwallex, says: “This is a critical milestone for Airwallex. It marks our entry into Latin America and our commitment to building truly global and proprietary financial infrastructure. Our team's ability to drive more than 460% revenue growth in the Americas region is a testament to the vast, unmet demand for end-to-end fintech solutions that allow organisations to operate at a global scale.\n\n“With the acquisition of MexPago, we’re on a path to become the number one payments and financial platform for modern businesses to go global.”\n\nLuis Castillejos Ordaz, CEO of MexPago, adds: “Airwallex’s ability to connect companies across borders is unparalleled. The combination of MexPago’s payments capabilities in Mexico and Airwallex’s global financial infrastructure will unlock exciting opportunities for companies in Mexico to operate globally, and for companies around the world to operate in Mexico. I look forward to working closely with Airwallex to obtain the necessary approvals and to ensure a smooth transition of ownership.”\n\nAirwallex makes senior hires at San Francisco base\n\nAirwallex has also announced a series of senior hires in its San Francisco hub, further boosting its credentials in the region.

    text: "Top LATAM music distributor FaroLatino expands in US, Mexico, Spain\n\nThe top music distributor in LATAM, FaroLatino, has opened new offices in the US, Mexico, and Spain, a rebranding, and an extensive range of services for artists and creators.\n\nIndie Spotlight from A2IM\n\nFor more than 25 years, at FaroLatino we have centered our attention on providing extraordinary service for our partners: independent recording artists and content creators. Our organization has evolved to adapt to the ever-changing music industry, ensuring that we always meet, and exceed, the standard our partners expect. It is thanks to our high levels of quality that have allowed us to remain relevant in the market over two decades. Working in capricious circumstances and being safe in the knowledge that we enjoy who we are today as a company and individuals, is what guides us to be inquisitive about what the future holds.\n\nA wide variety of artists and labels want to take a leap of faith and become independent, looking to control their content. Because of this, we understood that our partners need more than just an aggregator: they need an ally to help them to amplify and manage their content, and in many cases, produce it. Our record label, FaroLatino Music, was conceived to fulfill this need, and allows us to act as sponsors in concerts including Santaferia in La Quinta Vergara (Chile) and the Chilean Wey Festival in Mexico City.\n\nDuring the COVID‑19 pandemic that shook the world and the music industry, we have learned to blur and eliminate geographical borders. We have created collaborations between artists from different territories and genres, which have led to a significant increase in their audiences all over the world. Our presence in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Spain, Uruguay and the US makes us the best partner for those labels and independent artists who want to take their content to the next level.\n\n‘Particularly in the US, we work towards amplifying our Latin American partners’ content, and vice versa! The fact that we were born and raised in Latin America means we have developed our expertise in the territory, as well as the resources, and the connections to conquer the audience’ states Javier Fainzaig, CEO of FaroLatino.\n\nFurthermore, the market dynamism and our desire to face new challenges, has led us to create a new logo, website, and business structure to develop promising future prospects in the years to come. Today, not only do we define ourselves as more than a distributor, but we also adapt to the demands of our artists and partners by embracing their content and providing the necessary tools and strategies to turn them into success.\n\nOur essence remains unchanged, thanks to the relationships we have always been nurturing. This is why we value our membership with Merlin, the independent’s digital music licensing partner. Through their premium deals, Merlin has helped our artists and creators increase revenue and access more opportunities. Merlin ensures that we can better compete at the highest levels, all while protecting the value of music. We remain the same, our core values and strength never waver: our personalized treatment, our excellent team of professionals, our honesty – the fundamental pillar that is the core of everything we do – and of course, the fact that we are a company of musicians for musicians!\n\nShare on:",

    text: "SINGAPORE — In the next decade, APAC will represent 40% of total growth in global health spending, expanding at a rate almost double that of the rest of the world – making both presence and investment in APAC more critical than ever. To help Havas Health & You (HH&Y) meet the needs of this exponential growth and of the global brands across their portfolio of clients, the network today announced the expansion of its Southeast Asia (SEA) Village, bringing the unique business model to bolster capabilities in the region.\n\nHH&Y has made significant investments in senior leadership to support this expansion; in particular, hiring Jini Mathai as Regional Business Strategy Director for SEA. With HH&Y’s growth in Asia at over 20% per annum, this move compliments its 2021 launch of a regional hub under the leadership of Susan Josi, Managing Director, SEA & Middle East (ME). Located in Singapore, Jini has nearly two decades of experience providing strategic guidance for clients across health specialties, and his expertise alongside Susan’s offers global and local health brands a range of much-needed capabilities across the region.\n\nAPAC is home to almost 60% of our global population and includes some of the world’s most populous countries. It is also very diverse, characterized by changing demographic trends as well as rapid urbanization in most countries. As the population grows, the opportunities exist two-fold – firstly for global brands who want a fluent and meaningful presence across APAC, but also for regional brands looking to expand who would benefit from the breadth and size of the world’s largest health network in HH&Y.\n\nSponsor\n\n“I’m excited to take forward this unique collaborative Village model which is ideal for a region experiencing such rapid innovation and change,” said Jini Mathai, Regional Business Strategy Director, HH&Y SEA. “The pandemic has been a catalyst for health brands to explore novel engagement models. HH&Y is well poised to cater to this through its rich experience in music, gamification and innovation which totally differentiates us as an agency. Our digital innovation lab is one of a kind and helps use scientific creativity to develop solutions for real unmet human needs. I look forward to unlocking this power of innovation through our Village model for our client partners in the region.”\n\nThis move further solidifies the activity of HH&Y across nine countries in APAC – Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Korea, Japan, Greater China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The network is the market leader in China and Japan and is continuing to recruit in India, Singapore, and the Philippines to expand capabilities across these markets.\n\n“Continued growth in the region means that the health world must unquestionably stay attuned to this growing pool of talent, incredible innovation and expansive population,” said Charles Houdoux, CEO APAC & LATAM, HH&Y. “Our unmatched expertise here offers brands both locally and globally tremendous opportunity, and with the partnership of Vivendi, Havas, and our broader network, we are poised to continue to lead as we double down on our capabilities in digital transformation, multichannel engagement through data, content and much more.”",

      "Ripple’s Asian Expansion Skyrockets: Singapore Becomes APAC Frontrunner for On-Demand Liquidity Service",
    text: "Advertisement\n\nRipple is experiencing substantial growth in Asia, particularly in Singapore, where its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service witnessed a five-fold increase in transactions in 2022. The company plans to continue expanding its presence in the region sustainably. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has also granted Ripple in-principle regulatory approval, further boosting its prospects in the region.\n\nRahul Advani, Asia-Pacific (APAC) Policy Director at Ripple, said on Twitter, “With good progress being made on our Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) license application, Ripple is more motivated than ever to pursue our vision of revolutionising cross-border payments and developing tokenisation solutions to solve real-world problems.”\n\nHong Kong Pilot Program\n\nRipple is also actively involved in a pilot program for central bank digital currency (CBDC) with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Hong Kong is emerging as a potential hub for virtual assets, with its own set of rules for cryptocurrency exchanges serving local residents and upcoming regulations for stablecoins. This development generates excitement within the industry, along with the crypto-specific regulations in Singapore, Japan, and the European Union.\n\nWith the impending license in Singapore, where much of its on-demand liquidity transactions occur, Ripple can further expand its presence in the APAC region and enhance the use of its ODL solution. The Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) focus on supporting real-world use cases rather than crypto speculation has positively influenced the company.\n\nRegulatory Clarity is Key\n\nAs local crypto regulations are expected to evolve, Ripple will need to comply with guidelines that protect investors and build trust to drive blockchain adoption for frictionless cross-border payments, addressing the inefficiencies of legacy financial infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In jurisdictions like Singapore, Japan, and Hong Kong, regulators are willing to sit down and have a conversation with you. You understand exactly what’s regulated and what’s not regulated,” Advani added, saying that in the United States, things are not that straightforward even with the recent ruling by Judge Torres.\n\nOn July 13, the court dismissed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) assertion that XRP is a security and dismissed the SEC’s complaint against Ripple, its CEO, and its chair. This historic decision affirms that XRP is not a security, a major victory for Ripple and the whole U.S. crypto market. The decision sets a precedent for other crypto assets and tokens in the United States, challenging the SEC’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies through enforcement.\n\nRipple appears to be firmly focused on Asia, whilst the SEC has hinted that it may appeal the decision, leaving the US subject to legal ambiguity. After establishing Ripple’s APAC headquarters in Singapore in 2017, the city saw a large volume of ODL transactions and a five-fold increase in 2022. This comes in addition to a doubling of staff in Singapore, with further expansions already in the planning.\n\nThe MAS is now working on regulations to support investor protection, which could entail demands for client asset segregation, keeping assets in trust, and daily reconciliation, likely proving vital in fostering acceptance of blockchain technology and fostering confidence.",

    text: "Finish software vendor Tecnotree has opened a research & development center in the Argentinean city of Cordoba.\n\nSituated in a business park called ‘Ciudad Empresaria’, the R&D center will set the stage for the company to expand operations to other parts of Latin America, stated Tecnotree in a press release.\n\n“Leveraging Tecnotree’s global network and experience, the new office will further strengthen our service capabilities in Latin America,” said Armando Martinez, Regional Vice-President of Tecnotree.\n\n“We have sensed the economic opportunities arising from the region and will contribute to its development.”\n\nHeadquartered in Espoo, Finland, Technotree is not new to Latin America. It is already running offices in Ecuador and Peru, but it is not clear as to how many people it has employed in the region.\n\nThe company was previously known as Tecnomen but rebranded as Tecnotree in 2008 when it acquired Indian software services provider Tifetree for US$46 million. Though it has 11 delivery centers across the world, a large majority of its workers are based out of India.\n\nSign up for our Nearshore Americas newsletter:\n\n\n\nIn Latin America, most of its clients are telecom carriers. In December 2020, it landed a deal with Claro, a subsidiary of Mexican telecom giant America Movil, to provide solutions for virtualization.",

      "Pluria’s Expansion To LatAm – ‘The world is a blank canvas open for business’",
    text: "Pluria is a remote & hybrid work solution that helps companies keep their distributed teams connected and engaged by giving them access to nearby workspaces. The start-up was founded in 2020 and in May 2023 it raised a $2M seed round to expand even more. We’ve talked to the founders, Andrei Cretu and Gabriela Draghia, about their very outside of the box approach of expanding internationally to Latin America as an early-stage start-up, and their plans for the future.\n\nWhere do we find Pluria today? Tell us more about the latest developments of the company.\n\nAndrei: We are a distributed team of 25 people, half of which are in Europe, and the other half in Latin America, and we are living the dream of building a new product and using it to have a better work experience, to get together in different spaces, to have lunch with the team or use it individually.\n\nIn Pluria, we are firm believers in the power of in-person collaboration and flexible work models. This is the hybrid work dilemma: can you have both of the above, without sacrificing the flexibility that is valued so much today? We think it is possible and companies can have teams that are productive, engaged, collaborate better, meet in the physical space and at the same time the companies can expand the HQ from one single space to a multitude of offices their employees can access anytime they want.\n\nAnd this space is getting larger every day: we are now present in 13 countries, mainly LatAm, our main market, that includes countries like Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and now Uruguay. We are also present in Europe, Iberia – Spain and Portugal – and in our home country, the place where the magic happens and everything started – the Balkans, in Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nWhy did you decide to expand to LATAM? What factors led to this decision?\n\nAndrei: I don’t know of any start-up that actually took this step so early, and I will point out a few factors.\n\nBecause of my past start-up, 7card, now a part of GymPass, I got a bit closer to seeing the opportunities there because GymPass is the global leader as a fitness subscription model and they are originally from São Paulo, Brazil. As I was phasing out from my old start-up, I knew some people in the region and got to know it better.\n\nThere are far too many instances when founders, even today, in a world where technology has zero delivery costs, think of going international and only think in terms of geographic proximity. But if you’re in a market where the services are distributed via the Internet, then you should think of the globe as like an empty blank canvas, and really think of the addressable market, how big that is, how big is the pain point that you’re solving.\n\nWe took into consideration any particularities that might help build some competitive product there, such as the fact that we speak Spanish reasonably well.\n\nGabriela: I’d been exposed to LatAm only as a tourist, and it was an emerging market 10 years behind Eastern Europe, and more than 10 times bigger.\n\nAnd what we discovered later on was the fact that it’s not just an emerging market with a lot of opportunities, but it’s also the territory of recruitment for US companies, with a lot of people being hired remotely, on the same timezone and with lower costs. Working remotely when you are living with a multi generation family in the same location can be challenging.\n\nAfter 2 years of operating in this market, can you share some Pluria achievements in LATAM?\n\nAndrei: Three months down the road after launching in Colombia, not only did we have a fairly solid network of spaces, which is kind of a hygiene element for us, but we already had the first client.\n\nWhat happened and led us from having operations in Colombia to where we are today is that our clients started opening new locations throughout LatAm and encouraged us to extend to other cities as well.\n\nIt’s a healthy way of expanding because we are going after the locations that are relevant to our clients now and that will eventually become relevant to other clients as well because there’s a trend of long term companies operating in other markets. Now we can proudly say to companies that we are a single interface for remote teams across all of Latin America, which is a very, very strong statement.\n\nWhat’s the benefit for companies? What is your USP?\n\nGabriela: There are other global players who chase vanity KPIs like ‘we have some 5000 spaces in the network’, when the reality is that they’ve massively affiliated a lot of spaces, some of which are not even available anymore.\n\nWe are proud to say that the likelihood of that happening in the Pluria network is extremely small. The fact that the network is curated means that the end user should have the best experience possible because they know when they go to the space that someone will expect them, will greet them and give them a tour if it’s the first time using this service, and so on.\n\nWhat are the plans for the company for the next 18 months?\n\nAndrei: We fell in love with the idea of solving a problem for companies whose teams are becoming increasingly more remote and experience the problem of reduced collaboration and engagement. Now it is the right moment to solve the hybrid work dilemma.\n\nIn terms of objectives, everything we build now is focused on solving this pain point for companies, to help them bring their teams together, to collaborate better no matter how distributed they are.\n\nWe’ll soon release a team engagement feature in the Pluria app that will allow our users to invite their colleagues or friends in a space in the network, connecting with other people in a natural way. This is how teams get together and we want to offer them the best tool to do it on their own terms, in spaces that fit their needs, because we strongly believe that the ideal hybrid work setup is unique to every company and we can help them find it.\n\nGabriela: One year ago we would have said something totally different about what Pluria does, but this is the magic of building a new solution: we are discovering new nuances every day about how our product can help companies and their employees and how we can have a positive impact on the lives of people. And that’s what drives us.\n\nPluria is also a way for us to help companies to reduce their carbon footprint. The ESG objectives that companies will have from January 2024 on reporting all initiatives that they take to reduce their carbon footprint and the way we align to them is also one aspect that we are proud of.\n\nThe sustainability aspect of our product was not in the spotlight in the previous years. Even if, at least in other regions, this was not something on top of the public agenda one or two years ago, we see it now as more and more important.\n\nYou’ve expanded to different regions and cultural spaces, and each of them comes with different particularities. Did you notice any different behavioral habits between these regions that you operate in?\n\nAndrei: The differences that we see, like a preference for more meeting bookings in Latin America and one for individual desk bookings in Europe tell us that working together matters for people: even when you work individually, you want to have other people around you, like in a café or a coworking. If you want to be isolated you stay at home.\n\nYou mentioned that Eastern Europe and Latin America have one thing in common, and that is that US companies and big corporations open offices there. But do you find any similarities other than that, between the two markets?\n\nAndrei: In terms of similarities, both regions are somehow emergent. Eastern Europe is trying to close the gap with Western Europe, Latin America is doing the same with the US. We share the common DNA of not being born in a royal family, but in difficult geographies, where we had to struggle. Maybe this explains why both regions have this desire to build something new.\n\nAnother similarity is that both regions have very smart people, well educated, and at relatively low cost, which is why we see a lot of the remote hiring corridors from Western Europe.\n\nGabriela: There is also the element of belonging, the professionals in these markets are extremely proud to work for US companies, I dare to say even our team is extremely proud to work for a European start-up, while the Romanians are typically quite emotionally attached to the companies for which they are working.\n\nAndrei: Finally, I always explain that Latin America is Eastern Europe on steroids – same DNA, but bigger in terms of size and business opportunities.",

    text: "Yubico has announced expanded global availability of YubiEnterprise Subscription has transformed the way that enterprises purchase, upgrade, and support YubiKey security keys. Now, Yubico channel partners across the world, including those in Australia and New Zealand, can efficiently sell strong YubiKey authentication at scale.\n\nYubico has already signed up its first Asia Pacific client to YubiEnterprise Subscription, which is a regional council. The three-year subscription deal has been secured by Yubico’s partner, NQBE, in Queensland. More details on this deal will be announced soon.\n\n“As security threats evolve so rapidly, the technologies designed to protect users do too. Having the ability to update our customers’ YubiKeys to the latest model each year with YubiEnterprise Subscription will ensure they have all the latest security protocols in place,” said Andrew Phillips, CEO at NQBE, Queensland, Australia.\n\nIn today’s new norm of remote work, and with increases in COVID-related phishing attacks and credential theft, organisations realise the necessity of YubiKey hardware-based authentication. YubiEnterprise Subscription enables organisations to leverage flexible and cost-effective ways to procure strong authentication and achieve the highest level of phishing defence at scale.\n\n“YubiEnterprise Subscription provides considerable cost and time savings, helping organisations to simplify their approach to strong authentication as their business evolves,” said Fredrik Krantz, Senior Vice President, EMEA and APAC, Yubico. “With immediate success from the initial roll out in the US and Canada, we are proud to now offer YubiEnterprise Subscription to our APAC channel partners.”\n\nHistorically, YubiKeys have been sold on a per-device basis. Now, with YubiEnterprise Subscription, customers are able to purchase YubiKeys on a per-user basis and experience predictable OpEx spending.

The sale price was undisclosed.\n\nZen Plaza (image: Nomura Real Estate)\n\nFor Nomura, the transaction is the latest in its overseas expansion ambitions, having announced plans in April to invest about JPY 300bn (US$2.8bn) in overseas real estate over the next nine years.\n\nThe deal comes as increased demand for grade A office space has exceeded supply levels in HCMC, driving up average asking rent at a rate of roughly 2% to 2.5% a quarter in recent times, says Colliers.\n\nThe multi-let Zen Plaza faces Nguyễn Trãi Street in District 1 and is mostly occupied by Japanese and other foreign businesses.\n\nPrior to the transaction, Nomura had bought the Sun Wah Tower multi-let office building and participated in the Phú Mỹ Hưng Midtown condominium project in HCMC.\n\nIn HCMC, the office market is said to be nearing capacity, with average occupancy among grade A office buildings at 95% and 88% among grade B offices.\n\nWhile 113,000 sq.m. of new grade A and B office stock is expected in HCMC by the end of the year, Colliers expects demand will continue to outpace supply and average asking rent will continue to steadily rise.\n\nThe Japanese property group is looking for further investments in the city, having established a local subsidiary in HCMC earlier this year.\n\nIt’s the company’s fifth overseas office in Asia, with local entities in Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.\n\nUnder the expansion, Nomura has invested in real estate throughout Bangkok, the Chinese city of Shenyang, Manila and other locations.\n\nListed on the Tokyo stock exchange, Nomura Real Estate is headquartered in Tokyo and has almost 7,000 employees.",

    title: "Wasabi Technologies: new expansion targets APAC growth",
    text: "While the cloud services market is dominated by cloud titans including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud, many small specialist cloud service providers are emerging. Rather than offering a full range of cloud services, these specialist providers focus on specific products or solutions either targeting specific industries (finance, healthcare, among others) or certain functions (for example, storage). Their revenues may be orders of magnitude lower compared to the top hyperscalers, but these specialist providers have earned a place in the overall market through their specialization and simple delivery models which reduce the time needed for customers to migrate to the platform.\n\nWasabi Technologies, founded in 2017, is one of these specialist cloud service providers. Focusing only on cloud storage, it earned US$275 million funding within five years. As a high-growth company, Wasabi continues to expand its global presence, and now has 13 data centers established in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific serving customers globally.\n\nWasabi's main advantage comes from its simplicity\n\nSince its inception, Wasabi has been laser-focused on the cloud storage market segment. Based on experience, it is optimizing the storage architecture of AWS' Amazon S3, to create a cheaper, higher-capacity cloud storage product. We will use an example to explain its advantages in pricing. Let's assume an SMB customer needs 10T of storage space per month, 100G/day of download traffic, and 500,000 requests/day of upload and download, the storage prices from different vendors are as follows.\n\nWasabi is far cheaper when compared with the cloud titans, primarily due to simpler chargebacks. It charges only for storage capacity and does not charge egress fees, fees for retrieving data in the cloud, or fees for requests for API. The secret to sustaining its pricing is the software it uses to achieve a set of in-house-created hardware and software efficiencies, which allows the product to maintain a high speed at which data is read and written while expanding the driversâ capacity.\n\nWasabi has no complex product features or chargeable items, allowing salespeople to quickly understand the product and explain their sales pitches to customers. They can clearly explain what Wasabi's storage is and how it is billed. Customers with no experience or technical foundation in cloud services often spend significant time migrating to the cloud, which partly stems from the complexity of platforms. Wasabi's proposed simplicity reduces the learning curve and costs for customers, freeing up resources to focus elsewhere.\n\nWasabi has a clear channel and customer strategy\n\nWasabi's market expansion has always been based on qualified demand. It will expand business where it identifies opportunities. Its go-to-market strategy is partner-led, as it builds relationships with top channel partners in different regions (for example, SHI in the US and NTT in Japan) to expand through partnersâ existing networks. This strategy allows it to quickly build a customer base in new markets, even when its own brand is unknown. In addition, the single product offering places it in non-competition with software companies like Veeam and MSP360, allowing it to build key technology relationships and integrate their respective offerings.\n\nIt has two current customer types. One are businesses at the early stages of cloud migration. These businesses are looking to change their storage approach but lack experience in migrating to the cloud and the technical know-how to navigate âfull-featuredâ platforms. The other type are businesses that have high data storage requirements (for example, video surveillance companies). These data-intensive businesses want to reduce the cost of storage. Wasabi services both types of customers by replacing the way companies expand their capacity through purchasing hardware storage, winning customers over with its simplicity of use and lower prices. These advantages are likely to appeal to more customer types as multi-cloud deployments gain popularity.\n\nWasabi enters the Asia-Pacific market\n\nAsia-Pacific is a highly competitive market for cloud providers, especially over the past few years due to the rapid growth of the digital economy. Many hyperscalers, such as AWS and Alibaba Cloud, have added new data centers across the region. The opening of Wasabi's data center in Singapore follows three other openings across APAC, which once again validates the surging demand for cloud services in the region. Overall, Wasabiâs emergence will hardly change the overall market landscape in the short-term as the scale of the established Cloud titans is significant, and they play in sectors that Wasabi does not target. The potential threat to these vendors, from Wasabi's presence in the market, will take time to be broadly felt, although sometimes the toughest competitors are those that float under the radar. Furthermore, Wasabi's emphasis on the channel could offer some teaching for many cloud vendors that are predominately direct-led. The lack of a clear channel strategy affects certain cloud vendors, especially the China-headquartered ones which also have identified the rest of Asia Pacific as a growth region.\n\nThe launch of the fourth data center means Wasabi has seen the APAC market as a promising market to expand into. Its trajectory in APAC started with high-cloud readiness countries like Japan and Australia. As more customers become comfortable with their cloud deployments, they may find it more attractive to work with a full-service cloud provider to gain access to additional cloud services. Wasabi may eventually have to expand its portfolio further to compete from a feature standpoint. But for the time being, its first step though is to cement the Wasabi brand as a cloud storage provider throughout Asia-Pacific.",

      "Amazon web services expands in Taiwan: impact on the APAC digital landscape",
    text: "Welcome back, tech enthusiasts! Today, I’m excited to share some of the latest news in the ecosphere of web infrastructure. As you may know, web infrastructure is the backbone of our digital experience and an essential ingredient in our journey toward a connected world. This time, we’re turning our gaze to the ever-growing tech powerhouse, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS recently announced plans to create a new infrastructure region in Taiwan, aiming to amp up its investments in the Asia-Pacific. Let’s take a deeper dive into what this expansion means for AWS and the broader APAC region.\n\nAWS pushes deeper into APAC\n\nAWS has been gradually increasing its footprint in the Asia-Pacific region, as shown by their recent investment in Taiwan. The new infrastructure region, set to launch by mid-2025, will be AWS’s second infrastructure region in Taiwan and will feature 3 Availability Zones. This move is a clear indication of AWS’s commitment to expand its influence and position itself as a strong contender in the APAC digital landscape.\n\nThese Availability Zones, essentially secure data centers, will ensure that AWS’s clients in Taiwan and adjacent regions receive a robust and reliable cloud service, avoiding any potential system failures. Furthermore, such a development is expected to stimulate economic growth and foster tech innovations in the region. Local businesses, startups, and government organizations will gain improved access to advanced cloud technologies, paving the way for a brighter tech-enabled future.\n\nWhat this means for Taiwan and APAC\n\nThis expansion is not just big news for AWS, but also for Taiwan and the broader APAC region. By significantly boosting its infrastructure in Taiwan, AWS is effectively contributing to the creation of a growing tech ecosystem. But the ripple effects of such a move are far-reaching and have the potential to shape the technological landscape in the entire APAC region.\n\nIncreased digital innovations, job creation, and enhanced e-government services are among the potential positive impacts. Moreover, such a development can inspire other tech giants to explore opportunities in APAC, thus creating a virtuous cycle of investments, innovation, and growth in the region. This truly aligns with my belief – technology should always focus on empowering and connecting people around the globe.\n\nNotwithstanding the various benefits, we must also consider the potential challenges that come with these developments. Data security, regulatory compliance, and managing complex integration are just a few of the many aspects that need to be taken into account.\n\nAs technology enthusiasts, we must continuously stay abreast of these developments, understanding their impacts, and learning how to navigate this exciting digital era.\n\nThere is no denying the significance of AWS’s expansion into Taiwan. It marks a key milestone in the broader effort to bolster the digital infrastructure of the APAC region. As we keep our eyes peeled for further developments, we also look forward to the new opportunities and challenges this significant move will present. Remember, in this digital expedition, it is crucial to grasp every learning opportunity and stay ahead of the curve.",

      "38% of Footwear Market to Originate from APAC, Market Expands with Rising Demand for Exclusive Designer Collections",
    text: "Visualize Footwear Market using Technavio Intelligence. Browse Summary of the Research Report to Learn More\n\nVendor Insights-\n\nThe footwear market report also offers information on several market vendors, including adidas AG, ASICS Corp., Burberry Group Plc, New Balance Athletics Inc., Nike Inc., PUMA SE, Skechers USA Inc., Under Armour Inc., VF Corp., and Wolverine World Wide Inc. among others. The footwear market is fragmented and the vendors are deploying organic and inorganic growth strategies to compete in the market. Moreover, to make the most of the opportunities and recover from post COVID-19 impact, market vendors should focus more on the growth prospects in the fast-growing segments, while maintaining their positions in the slow-growing segments.\n\nadidas AG - The company offers a wide range of footwear under the brands of Reebok and Adidas.\n\nBurberry Group Plc - The company offers a wide range of footwear such as sandals, formal shoes, boots, sneakers, and others.\n\nNew Balance Athletics Inc. - The company offers a wide range of footwear such as lifestyle shoes, baseball shoes, hiking and trail shoes, work shoes, sandals, soccer shoes, boots, and others.\n\nGet More Information on Macro & Micro Economic Factor Analysis, Statistical Tools, and Trend Projection. Request Sample Copy (Including Graphs & Tables) of this Report\n\nSegmentation Analysis & Forecasts\n\nThe footwear market is segmented by Product (non-athletic footwear and athletic footwear), End-user (women, men, and children), and Distribution channel (offline and online). The footwear market share growth in the nonathletic footwear segment will be significant during the forecast period. The key factors driving the demand for non-athletic footwear include the growing consumer fashion consciousness and the rising introduction of trendy shoes in the men and children segments. In addition, the demand for private-label brands is increasing due to the availability of top-quality product offerings at low prices. The growth in the demand for premium non-athletic footwear is mainly attributed to the rising disposable income of the population across the globe. High disposable incomes of consumers raise their spending power, empowering them to spend more on premium fashion products such as footwear.\n\nDownload Sample Report Using Business Email ID to Gain Further Insights on the Market Contribution of Various Segments on Higher Priority\n\nLatest Drivers & Challenges of the Market-\n\nFootwear Market Driver:\n\nDesign and material innovations leading to product premiumization:\n\nThe vendors are constantly innovating and introducing new patterns and designs due to market competition and evolving customer demand because of continuous changes in the fashion industry. Customers seek footwear for formal, especially leather footwear, and casual, such as sports or canvas shoes, purposes. Therefore, the vendors regularly expand their brand and product lines. Athletic footwear belongs to the promoted product segment. The demand for such footwear has been increasing because of the availability of innovative products, which offer premium appeal, that can also be used as partywear. High demand and premiumization allow manufacturers to increase the price of their products. Innovations in designs and celebrity endorsements of products have enabled vendors to cater to the demand from the high-income customer base. Key vendors design personalized and customized athletic shoes to expand their customer base.\n\nFootwear Market Challenge:\n\nRising labor cost and fluctuating raw material prices:\n\nSeveral international vendors, such as Prada,Tapestry, and D&G, have their own production facilities or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in Asian countries, such as China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. This is due to the availability of low-cost manufacturing and the low cost of operations in these countries. However, in the last decade, the cost of labor in these countries rose rapidly, which increased the cost of production. Evolving and dynamic economic conditions have also adversely affected the cost of labor in countries from which the vendors import their supplies. Therefore, the rising cost of production for the manufacturers lowers their profit margins. Fluctuations in raw material costs are another challenge for vendors. The cost of these materials is also dependent on transportation costs. The transportation costs incurred by companies include taxes, duties, and fuel costs. A major portion of the transportation cost incurred by the vendors is the cost of fuel, which fluctuates frequently. An increase in transportation costs increases the cost of end products.\n\nFor More Insights on the Latest Drivers, Trends, and Challenges that will Help Companies Evaluate and Develop Growth Strategies.

Two brands then partnered up to open its first store in Seoul. Less than a year after the expansion into South Korea, Eggslut opened its first store in Singpore in September 2021. The brand has two stores in Singapore currently.\n\nJoin Content 360 - Hong Kong: Stories For A New Era where over 150 content marketers come together to shape the future.

    text: "To celebrate the International Coffee Day on October 1, 2021 , O R is keen to strengthen the global coffee sector by promoting the sustainable expansion of its flagship coffeehouse chain - Café Amazon, expecting to achieve a total of 1,000 outlets across Asia by 2025.\n\nOR plans to purchase over 38,000 tons of raw coffee beans from local growers in Thailand in the next five years, as part of its commitment to promoting inclusive growth and supporting local communities.\n\nBANGKOK, Sept. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- PTT Oil and Retail Business Plc. (OR), Thailand's leading fuel retailer and retail business operator, is currently ramping up its efforts to globally expand its in-house Café Amazon coffee chain with new outlet opening spanning across Asia and the Middle East. Café Amazon is OR's crown jewel for driving the company's new business direction \"Retailing Beyond Fuel\". Under the five-year growth plan starting 2021, Café Amazon expected to achieve a total international stores count of more than 1,000 that will drive total system store sales to reach around USD1,000 million in 2025.\n\n\n\nPTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited\n\n\n\nCafé Amazon in Laos\n\nAccording to OR's CEO Jiraphon Kawswat, to celebrate the International Coffee Day on October, 1 2021, OR is excited to unveil the new growth journey of our flagship business - Café Amazon. Since 2002 Café Amazon was initially developed as an in-house coffee chain for PTT Station, OR's retail fuel service stations. Entering its 20 years of establishment, the coffee chain has already been the largest franchise network in Southeast Asia and become the world's sixth largest coffee chain by number of outlets. According to Euromonitor, Café Amazon was ranked among the world's top 12 specialist coffee and tea shop brands as of 2019 in terms of revenue. By June 2021, Café Amazon has 3,432 outlets in Thailand, as well as 298 outlets across 10 markets in Asia including Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, Oman, Myanmar, Vietnam, China, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan.\n\nCafé Amazon proclaimed its franchising outlets as the destination where people can meet, relax and enjoy its unique high-quality coffee with variety of drinks and snacks at everyday price. In a closer look, fast-growing success story of Café Amazon lies far beneath the surface of its aromatic signature coffee blend and relaxing ambiance as suggested by the slogan \"Taste of Nature\".\n\nUnder OR's \"Retailing Beyond Fuel\" business direction, Café Amazon franchising will continue to be a significant non-oil revenue generation channel. The coffee house chain has been a key driver to promote inclusive growth by capitalizing the new opportunities with business partners on the model of granting master franchise rights to established F&B operators in the global markets.\n\nWith master franchisee program uniquely designed to ensure setup for success, Café Amazon provides partners extensive training from experts, strong R&D capabilities for localizing coffee and drink menu, support on marketing and IT system with data analytics, as well as on-the-ground staff coaching and troubleshoot issues. Café Amazon also set up an expert team to provide investment details, advise and support prospective master franchisees.\n\nCafé Amazon has been widely favored by its \"green oasis ambiance\" and the unique and rich taste of coffee that win the heart of millions of customers. The coffee chain inherits OR's true business purpose of deeply committed to creating inclusive growth with members of the public and all stakeholders. The unique business model aimed at creating lasting impact on people and planet is a universal language not only widely embraced by people across Thailand, but also with proven track record in Cambodia, Laos and the Philippines after Café Amazon has ventured into these markets over a decade ago.\n\nSustainable Sourcing\n\nCafé Amazon launched Community Coffee Sourcing project to develop career skill and educate community enterprise of coffee farmers and also to be a steady distribution channel for community enterprise groups and farmers to ensure a fair-trade income for their sustainable career. Every coffee bean is carefully sourced from selected coffee farms across Thailand and meticulously roasted in its own proprietary roasting plant. Moreover, Café Amazon established the Amazon Inspiring Campus (AICA), which encompasses interactive exhibition on coffee story and the company's training center. Within the next five years Café Amazon plans to purchase over 38,000 tons of raw coffee beans from local growers in Thailand.\n\nCommitted to grow a sustainable business, Café Amazon not only aims to satisfy customers all over the world but also help empowering people, protecting the environment and supporting local communities. As a result, Café amazon will not only be a favorite sustainable coffee brand for international customers but also well-positioned to become the top five global players by store count and top 10 by revenue.\n\nGreen and Environmental Initiatives\n\nCafé Amazon has deeply imprinted the green concept at heart, reflecting in the design of modern green area, relaxing natural ambience, the use of fresh ingredients and sustainable material in the stores. The chain pioneered the Circular Living Concept store featuring stylish decorative items made from recycled waste, as well as launched upcycling product collection program to increase environmental awareness by using recycled waste to furnish the outlets.\n\nSocial Inclusiveness\n\nThe \"Café Amazon for Chance\" program is introduced as an operation of coffee shop that employs people with hearing impairment, the elderly and military veterans. Café Amazon also partner with Ratchasuda College, Mahidol University to train underprivileged and disabled workers to become baristas, as well as providing them with essential working skills. Currently the company has 13 Café Amazon outlets hiring people with hearing impairment and 228 outlets hiring the elderly.\n\nStrategic Partnership for a Powerful Value Chain\n\nRecent investment of Café Amazon in Peaberry, Thailand's leading coffee roaster and supplier of coffee bar equipment, helped drive the company's continued expansion through partnership synergy by strengthening its business value chain with access to efficient supply of materials, equipment and maintenance services from the partner.\n\nFor more details about Café Amazon's master franchise program please contact: Franchiseamazon@pttor.com\n\nAbout OR\n\nPTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited (OR) is PTT Group's Flagship in the oil and retail business to bring all stakeholders a balanced and sustainable value while developing the quality of life for the people and economy of the communities where it operates.

    title: "Q&A: Peter Finn on Finn Partners' expansion into APAC",
    text: "Three months ago, Finn Partners announced their acquisition of Ying Communications, a B2B PR and marketing firm. Campaign Asia-Pacific spoke with Peter Finn, the founding partner of Finn Partners, to learn about his motivations surrounding the move.\n\nWhat was the rationale behind acquiring Ying Communications?\n\nFinn Partners is one of the fastest growing international PR firms in the world, but until we acquired Ying Communications we did not have a presence in Asia Pacific. Our largest practice area is technology, and our tech clients have been asking for support in Asia Pacific. So, we have known for some time that we needed to extend Finn Partners into this region. One of the things we love about Ying is that it is both a PR and a digital marketing agency. PR and digital marketing are converging more than ever, so Ying’s strengths in both areas was an important plus for us.\n\nWhat are the factors that make an agency worthy of acquisition for long-term business growth?\n\nSince the launch of Finn Partners in Dec. 2011, we have made 10 acquisitions. During this time, more than 60 acquisition opportunities have come our way, so we are very selective in deciding which opportunities are worth pursuing. Our goals in growing through acquisitions are as follows.\n\nContinue to expand our management team who share our core values, the most important of which is “work hard and play nice.” We believe that we can be successful in business while placing a high priority on being decent people, having a heart, and a conscience. We are also very focused on creating the best place to work for our staff. We believe that the best place to work helps keep and attract the best staff, and that enables us to do the very best work for our clients. We were very happy to discover when we met Allan, Yin Ching and their management team that they shared this value and that they live it every day.\n\nStrengthening market share where we have an office, or enter a new market that is strategically important. The acquisition of Ying enabled us to do the second part of this.\n\nAdding practice expertise to support client needs. Tech is our largest practice area, and we are always looking for ways to continue to build on this strength. With the addition of the Ying team, we now have over 150 members of our staff in Asia, Europe and the US who concentrate solely on the tech sector, and we serve over 150 tech clients, working in almost every part of the tech ecosystem. We have deeper expertise in tech than almost any other agency, and we are very happy about this. Ying made us even stronger in an area in which we were already strong.\n\nWhat is your big picture vision for your firm in the marketing ecosystem?\n\nPR and digital marketing are converging. Our goal is to become one of the most respected integrated agencies in key markets around the world in our key sectors. Finn Partners is an independent agency, which gives us many advantages. Unlike the publicly held holding company agencies, we are not driven by quarter to quarter results. This makes it possible for us to invest in our business, and in our client relationships, for the long term. We made decisions that would not be possible to a publicly held firm. We believe this enables us to continuously strengthen the firm and to do better work for our clients. While Finn Partners is a rapidly growing global agency and has depth in many different specialty areas, we remain privately owned, and we believe that our independence gives us a strategic advantage in the marketplace.\n\nWhat is your approach in tracking the bottom line effectiveness of PR?\n\nThere are several ways in which we evaluate the effectiveness of our work.\n\nFirst, we have an in-house group of measurement and analytics experts who can evaluate the effectiveness of a PR campaign—from analyzing shifts in consumer perceptions and attitudes about a client’s brand to tabulating the qualitative and quantitative presence of a client’s key messages in media coverage. This specialty group can also measure the overall business impact of a campaign, meaning, how our PR work positively impacts a client’s bottom line.\n\nSecondly, our clients want to be viewed as innovators and thought leaders in their respective areas and today, this is achieved by designing PR campaigns that go viral in the digital and social ‘spheres. We are continuously monitoring the conversations in these areas and assessing if our programs are helping clients to achieve breakthrough moments that elevate and distinguish their products, services, and senior management.\n\nFinally, one of the best indicators of PR effectiveness is client retention and we are pleased to report that we have a low level of client turnover.\n\nWhat weaknesses did you offset by purchasing Ying?\n\nFinn Partners needed to expand into Asia Pacific, and the highest priority was to find a solution to serve our tech clients needing support in the region. The acquisition of Ying is the perfect first step for us in Asia Pacific.\n\nHow have the clients of Ying Communication benefited from the acquisition?\n\nYing’s clients in Asia were unequivocally positive about the acquisition, and they’ve shown great interest in how Finn Partners’ existing capabilities, industry expertise, and global reach would help strengthen our offerings to them. Already, within the first couple of months of the acquisition, the Ying team has tapped into Finn Partners’ CSR and education expertise to beef up our existing clients’ APAC CSR and education programs. We’re also jointly working on several new global retailers and projects, and we expect this momentum to continue.",

    text: "The past decade has been a period of rapid expansion for Latin American reinsurer Patria Re, seeing it reach well beyond the region and broaden its offering to all lines of business. The opening of a carrier in the US will further drive its growth.\n\nThe company’s success has been fuelled by cross-selling and maximising its existing distribution channels, and it’s now poised to build on its partnerships with managing general agents (MGAs) while addressing key issues for its continued health—notably, nurturing the talent pipeline.\n\nPatria Re’s chief executive officer Francisco Martinez (pictured) highlighted to Intelligent Insurer the ground covered in the past three years in particular, with rapid expansion outside of Latin America doubling Patria Re’s income.\n\n“We’re now about to close 2022 with an income of approximately $550 million, which is quite an achievement coming from a small company 10 years ago,” he said.\n\n“We’re very proud of the technical results we’ve achieved; the last decade has been very volatile in the cat arena, and in the last five years we’ve achieved a combined ratio of 89 percent.”\n\nOver the past five years, Patria Re has opened all lines of business, cross-selling through its existing client base and distribution channels to create a more diversified book of business.\n\nThe firm has accelerated its overseas expansion—its Lloyd’s special purpose arrangement 6125 was placed into run-off for 2021. The firm still has its London office, which is now writing double the income it did with SPS 6125.\n\nLatin America remains Patria Re’s core, and its cross-selling strategy aims to offer clients a solution for every need.\n\n“We’ve achieved that by going into joint ventures or strategic partnerships with people that have the expertise to sell certain products,” said Martinez. “We cannot develop everything in-house so we find partners who can add value for our existing clients.\n\n“Our operating structure is strong enough to offer the high-quality service our clients demand, and we have historically been known for being the first to pay a claim. We need to work hard to be the first one to pay with a portfolio that is probably three times the size and complexity that it used to be.”",

According to NBA's career page, the league is hiring for positions including marketing analytics and fan data lead, Asia content producer, social media analyst, and accountant in Singapore.\n\nWith the opening of the Singapore office, the NBA now has offices in 15 markets worldwide: Beijing, Dakar, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Lagos, London, Madrid, Manila, Mexico City, Mumbai, New York/New Jersey, Rio de Janeiro, Shanghai, Singapore and Toronto.\n\nThe NBA currently works with StarHub as its official media partner which distributes NBA programming. It also partnered with Decathlon which is an official licensee of the league. Several other global marketing partners that have dedicated teams in Singapore include Nike, EA, and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the video game NBA 2K.\n\nSingapore has previously played host to several fan and youth development events, including NBA 3X and Jr. NBA. The league also has a presence through its NBA games and programming, and the availability of NBA merchandise. As for its future expansion into other Southeast Asian markets, it is understood that the league's focus is to fully establish the Singapore office for now, which will allow it to focus more on Singapore and other countries in the region.\n\nAccording to Levy, APAC has proven to be a major growth region for the NBA over the past two decades. \"Opening an office in Singapore reflects the enormous opportunities to build on that positive momentum by working more closely with our valued partners and bringing our passionate fans in the region closer to their favourite NBA teams and players,\" he added.\n\nTwo years ago, it doubled down on eCommerce in APAC and Europe by selling cloth face coverings featuring NBA logos, done in collaboration with sport and entertainment merchandise manufacturer FOCO as well as Fanatics. Its primary objective then was to support communities affected by COVID-19, with 100% of the proceeds going to Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organisation with a mission to improve the health and lives of people affected by poverty or emergencies.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNBA tips off Fortnite partnership in line with playoffs\n\nNBA looks to engage Indonesian fans with Ramadan content\n\nDecathlon and NBA team up globally for league-branded merchandise\n\nNBA tips off new season with action-packed 'Only Here' spot featuring fans\n\nNBA and Titan announce multi-year merchandising partnership in PH\n\nNBA makes eCommerce push in APAC with team logo masks",

      "Language AI company Fano Labs fuels APAC expansion with its Series B funding round led by Openspace Ventures with participation from HSBC and Greater Good Investment",
    text: "TAIPEI, May 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fano Labs, the leading provider of performance language AI solutions, today announced the successful closure of its Series B round. Openspace Ventures, a leading venture capital firm in Southeast Asia, led the investment round, with participation from HSBC, Greater Good Investment, the family office of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Lo, and existing shareholders. With this new funding, Fano Labs will expand its footprint in further markets through the establishment of an office in Singapore, which will serve as the hub for international clients. Additionally, further investment will go into developing the product, with a focus on adding more APAC languages and launching its suite of Large Language Model (LLM) products.\n\nFano Labs is a performance language solution provider that uses AI to develop specialized Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Diarization, Voice Biometrics, Speech Synthesis and Natural Language Processing technologies for enterprise and public sector organizations. It has an in-house R&D team led by leading international scientists, researchers and artificial intelligence experts. Founded in 2015 as a spin-off from the University of Hong Kong and incubated by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Fano Labs has achieved significant milestones in securing enterprise clients in both private and public sectors, including HSBC, Citibank, DBS Hong Kong, Hang Seng Bank, The Bank of East Asia, Cathay, China Mobile Hong Kong, amongst others.\n\nWith a proven track record, the establishment of the international hub in Singapore has already been met with positive recognition by the Singapore government. The team has been accredited by Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), a statutory board under Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) this March. Being accredited underscores the product readiness and trustworthiness of Fano Labs for enterprises and government agencies in Singapore and beyond, who are seeking resilient and innovative language AI for critical organizational purposes.\n\nFano Lab uses R&D to tackle speech and language challenges unique to Asia\n\nFano Labs is tackling a fundamental issue with traditional speech recognition tools, which do not operate effectively in multilingual environments like Singapore and other regions in Asia – where speakers switch between different languages in a conversation and have localized dialects or accents. At the same time, conversations likely involve multiple speakers cross-talking. Fano Labs specializes in developing Mixed-Language Speech Recognition and Speaker Diarization technologies that allow computers to understand the nuances of real-life human conversations in these operating environments. Fano Labs' speech engine can automatically detect the languages used, and differentiate all speakers in any conversation. With these techniques, clients can achieve over 90% accuracy with their solutions, which makes Fano Labs one of the world's most accurate language AI engine providers. To date, it has developed a dedicated ASEAN mixed language model that includes English, Mandarin, Bahasa Malaysia, Bahasa Indonesia, Cantonese, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Tagalog, Japanese, French, Tamil, and Urdu.\n\nUtilizing Language AI in RegTech and WealthTech to Enhance Compliance and Customer Experiences\n\nCompliance is critical for all players in the financial services industry. Financial institutions must now look for new ways to adhere to new and more stringent compliance requirements in the most effective and efficient ways. In banks, for example, it is important to ensure interactions between relationship managers and customers never fall short of compliance standards. The process of product suitability assessment, risk assessment and risk disclosure has become more and more extensive. Manually analyzing a burgeoning quantity of recorded conversations is labour-intensive, expensive, and comes with a higher chance of critical information being accidentally missed.\n\nFano Lab's keystone product is an Interaction Analytics System, Callinter, that uses AI technology to automate the analysis of these audio recordings - automatically flagging to risk and compliance professionals those that may contain misconduct or mis-selling practices for further review. This enables banks to process hundreds of hours of audio within less than 1 hour, whilst operating 24/7. Callinter helps banks scale the examination rate by 20 times, increases compliance check efficiency by 2 times, and allows the risk team to take corrective measures less than 30 minutes after issues are reported. Collectively, banks can save millions of dollars and manpower, which improves their compliance services.\n\nGenerating added value for customer experience from existing conversations\n\nIn addition, Fano Labs' interaction analytics deliver added value by turning the voice of customers into actionable business insights. With AI, Callinter enables contact centers in banks and financial services institutions to identify emerging trends, recurring topics, and sentiments more quickly and easily. In case any customer complaint is detected, the system can analyze the root causes behind the issues real-time, and immediately alert the service agents for early handling. It can also create new commercial opportunities from regular customer conversations. By analyzing the rich datasets of customers' preferences, needs, and feedback, Fano Labs' solutions can inform business units on critical product and service improvements. Sales representatives are able to make data-driven decisions to enhance sales processes, tailor cross-sell and up-sell strategies and proactively address customers' needs. Based on the analysis, financial institutions can boost customer satisfaction levels (CSAT), understand their customers' needs better and deliver hyper-personalized services.\n\nLeveraging Language AI to Combat Fraud and Protect Society\n\nBanks and government agencies are working hard to stay ahead of the growing wave of fraud and phone scams. Fano Labs is addressing this in two ways. Firstly, this increase has left many of the existing communications channels for reporting real or suspected illegal activities at risk of being overwhelmed. Callinter uses AI to automatically detect relevant calls, ensuring the most urgent needs reach the risk control teams as fast as possible. With this real-time analysis, Callinter can reduce reporting time by 50%. Secondly, the solution can be used to detect identity thefts through voice recognition, and can even track down perpetrators by analyzing their speech patterns, keywords and phrases.\n\nFano Labs is also trusted by government authorities to collaborate on identifying common fraud activities with AI technologies. Callinter is used to accurately analyze audio records during criminal investigations, with its results being used as forensic evidence in prosecution proceedings. Fano Labs is also performing ongoing research on the application of AI to identify potential deepfake attacks.\n\nEmbarking on the Next Phase of International Growth, Backed by Investors' Confidence\n\nDr. Miles Wen, the co-founder & CEO of Fano Labs said, \"We are thrilled to receive strong support from Openspace Ventures, HSBC, and Greater Good Investment, which will fuel our expansion into the dynamic APAC market. We also appreciate the confidence from our existing shareholders including Horizon Ventures and Saltagen Ventures. By establishing our office in Singapore and leveraging our expertise in multilingual and Mixed-Language Speech Recognition, we are well-positioned to drive innovation and deliver impactful solutions that address the evolving needs of our customers in the APAC region.\"\n\nOpenspace Ventures also expressed confidence in Fano Labs' growth trajectory. \"Fano Labs' dedication to innovation and its proven track record in the AI space make them an exciting investment opportunity. We believe that Fano's expansion into the APAC market will unlock new avenues for growth and reinforce its position as a leader in the industry,\" said Jessica Huang Pouleur, Partner, Openspace Ventures.\n\nCommenting on the partnership, Ian Glasner, Group Head of Innovation, Ventures, and Digital Partnerships at HSBC said, \"Artificial Intelligence presents enormous opportunities to improve the way we work and how we serve our customers. Our investment is underpinned by a belief that Fano Labs' Voice AI technology can drive major improvements in key banking operations and customer servicing quality. We are proud to be supporting the Hong Kong tech ecosystem and we look forward to witnessing Fano Labs' continued success.\"\n\nGreater Good Investment, established by the co-founders of the global apparel manufacturing leader Crystal International Group Limited, is excited to join a group of esteemed investors in fuelling the next journey of Fano Labs. \"Fano Labs has consistently demonstrated its commitment to innovation and pioneering technologies for its clients. We are excited to be part of this dynamic and promising venture,\" stated Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Lo, directors of Greater Good Investment.\n\nWith the latest funding secured and strategic expansion plans underway, Fano Labs is in a prime position to grow in new international markets and continue its journey of innovation, solidifying its position as a global leader in language AI research and technology.\n\nMedia Assets: https://bit.ly/4aXcoJh\n\n\n\nCo-founder and CEO of Fano Labs Dr. Miles Wen (left) and co-founder Professor Victor O.K. Li (right).\n\nAbout Fano Labs\n\nFounded in 2015, Fano Labs is a language artificial intelligence company specializing in developing Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Diarization, Speaker Verification, and Natural Language Processing technologies for multilingual environments. Fano Lab's AI solutions have been widely adopted in banks and financial services, insurance, telecomm, utilities, government, regulators, and public sectors.",

Bridge is a Bain Capital Private Equity portfolio company and maintains offices in Mumbai, Kuala Lumpur and San Francisco.\n\nBridge\'s two new data centres, renamed MY01 and MY02 under Bridge Data Centres Malaysia Sdn Bhd, comprise approximately one million square feet of data centre facilities and 20 megawatts (MW) of critical IT load. MY01 and MY02 serve many domestic and global blue-chip customers from a diverse set of industries, and Bridge is planning to expand this footprint in Cyberjaya with a contiguous development of a further 20 MW, to cater for its large customer\'s scaling needs, as Asia Pacific prepares to become the most important data centre regional market by 2020, according to industry analysts.\n\n"We are excited to announce the completion of this complex transaction," said Michael Foust, Executive Chairman of Bridge Data Centres.

Its investment efforts are led by Pithambar (Preet) Gona who also serves as CFO.\n\n"To echo Kris\' comments, we have steadily built an investment team that can underwrite large greenfield developments, as well as execute on existing assets with complex transactions like this one we have announced today," said Gona.

It will focus on high-end prestige properties, residential homes in general, and off-plan projects, which are properties that have yet to be constructed. It will also provide property management services and facilitate the sale and leasing of commercial properties.\n\nQueensland 888’s oldest office has been operating for 50 years.\n\nThe franchise agreement is for an initial term of 15 years, with the possibility of renewal for another 15 years. ERA Singapore CEO Marcus Chu said the agreement opens the door into “a well-established yet progressively expanding real estate market”.\n\nApac Realty said in a statement: “The Queensland real estate market is anticipated to thrive in 2024, driven by growing demand for quality properties in major Australian cities and renewed interest from Asia.”\n\nWhile ERA Queensland will focus on marketing properties in the state to Australians, Mr Caraco, who has been in the real estate business for 44 years, said there has been an emergence of inquiries about Australian properties from Asia.\n\nSingaporeans can buy new properties or those still under construction in Australia, with approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board.\n\nMr Caraco also noted that property prices in Queensland hit an all-time high in May 2022, but took a hit after Australia’s central bank increased interest rates that month.\n\n“We now expect a gradual recovery due to low inventory and a relatively positive interest rate outlook. While Queensland’s real estate market eased in terms of volume of sales over the past year, valuation has risen 15 per cent,” he said.",

    text: "SAO PAULO, Aug. 2, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- On August 1, MINISO Brazil ERP-SAP system was officially launched, and the self-built logistics warehouse was put into use, marking the rapid development stage in the Brazilian market for MINISO.\n\n\n\nMINISO self-built logistics warehouse\n\nMINISO, a Japanese designer brand, entered the Brazilian market in February 2018, selling daily necessities, household goods, beauty and skin care products. With the characteristics of high quality, good design and affordable prices, MINISO quickly opened the market and became one of the important choices for local consumers to buy daily necessities.\n\nSo far, MINISO has opened more than 3,500 stores in over 80 countries and regions. Over 50 stores have been opened throughout Brazil, mainly in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nFor MINISO, the very beginning of development in Brazil, a brand new market, was not easy.\n\nDue to the diversified categories of taxes and frequently changing policies, it was hard to guarantee the financial accounting, logistics and transportation, relying on agency services provided by a third party to manage service quality and communication efficiency. In the past two years since entering Brazil, the third-party systems of MINISO, such as finance, IT and logistics were not well connected with the headquarters, which also affected the normal development of MINISO's business in Brazil.\n\nIn 2017, MINISO cooperated with IBM to establish the global business operation service platform, with SAP as its core system. It developed into a comprehensive digital platform linking supply chains, operations, finance, logistics and human resources through the analysis and decision-making of big data, refining operations and supporting the rapid expansion of MINISO.\n\nIn February 2019, MINISO headquarters decided to build its own ERP-SAP system and logistics warehouse in Brazil. The project was set up and started on March 1, and project personnel were sent to Brazil to work with the Brazilian subsidiary. After six months of construction the SAP system and self-built logistics warehouse were successfully launched on August 1st.\n\nThe MINISO ERP-SAP system and self-built logistics warehouse have been officially put into use in Brazil, enabling its internal process control to be comprehensively improved with the help of the new system. The system and the new IP products such as Marvel will take MINISO to the next stage of development in the local market.\n\nAccording to the director of MINISO Brazilian market, MINISO will enlarge the product category and speed up the new release of products in the Brazilian market in the future. Together with investors, MINISO will cover stores in all major cities throughout Brazil. Currently, MINISO's target market expansion areas are three southern states, which are SC, PR and RS, followed by central MG and northern Brazil. The total number of MINISO stores in Brazil will reach 300 in the future.\n\nPhoto - https://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20190802/2541961-1?lang=0",

    text: "Promoted by the University of the State of Amazonas, the DCP Yara Project aims to monitor and record the water quality indicators of the Amazon River basin in real-time.\n\nDiebold Nixdorf, a world leader in boosting and connecting commerce for the banking and retail industries, has announced news regarding the Yara Project, a Data Collection Platform (DCP) developed by the University of the State of Amazonas (UEA in Portuguese) to monitor the water quality in the Amazon River basin.\n\nUsing probes and electronic sensors installed in the Parintins region, the program now allows real-time monitoring of river water quality indicators, revealing data such as pH index, temperature, conductivity, turbidity and concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water.\n\nMarcelo Pagnam, Director, Diebold Nixdorf, said: “It is very gratifying to see the DCP Yara Project consolidating itself each day as a way to monitor and protect the quality of the water of the Amazon River. The project is evolving, overcoming the many challenges that a survey of this size always reserves.\n\n“All over the world, we have a great work of social and environmental responsibility, it is a great pride being able to contribute to an initiative to protect the Amazon.”\n\nHeld with the support of Diebold Nixdorf by UEA researchers and students on the Parintins and Manaus campuses, the Yara data collection platform has the principal mission to reduce the time and costs involved in the monitoring and analysis of the water of the Amazon River basin.\n\nCarlossandro Albuquerque, one of those responsible for creating the project, said: “We want to make the follow-up of the main quality indicators more agile and reliable. However, due to the different characteristics in each region, this sample collection always demands a great effort. Our program seeks to reduce these challenges by allowing the automated collection of information about water.”\n\nIn addition to Albuquerque, the initiative has the participation of professors Ieda Batista, José Camilo Ramos de Souza, Fábio Cardoso, Rafael Jovito, Raimundo Cláudio, Manoel Rendeiro and André Printes.\n\nAccording to Albuquerque, to solve these challenges, the DCP Yara project has been working to build hardware, firmware and software specially adapted to the local conditions and demands, allowing the implementation of a set of mini stations for data collection along the Amazon River.\n\n“We developed probes and sensors, for example, that need to be able to resist debris, vegetation, clay and even attacks by animals in the region. We reached many answers in this first year, and today, we have already started collecting data in the port of Parintins,” said Albuquerque.\n\nHe also reinforced that the choice of the region is a strategic decision since the city is at the beginning of the central belt of the Amazon River basin.\n\nIn addition to hardware and firmware, the DCP Yara project has developed specific software for data transmission, storage and analysis.\n\n“We have to ensure that the records made are sent automatically and reliably to all our laboratories in Manaus and Parintins, as well as to other public and private institutions that may be interested and can help in the management and preservation of Amazon,” said Albuquerque.\n\nAs a result, the Yara data collection platform will allow the construction of a historical series with values for comparisons and verifications necessary for the beginning of the complete mapping of the water and the Amazon region itself.\n\nDiebold Nixdorf has a long history with the ESG agenda, in addition to its solid presence in the Amazon region, including its factory in Manaus with more than 18,000 square meters and about 350 employees. The unit has water treatment and waste management, in addition to ISO 14000 certification, which refers to environmental management.\n\n“Today, more than 80% of the material we use in the production of our equipment is recycled,” said Pagnam, recalling that the local initiatives of the company are not limited to the environmental aspect.\n\n“Our goal is to help preserve the environment and contribute to its development, well-being and sustainable growth. It makes us happy and motivates us to support initiatives such as the Yara Project more closely.”\n\nAbout Diebold Nixdorf\n\nDiebold Nixdorf is a world leader in developing connected commerce. The company automates, digitizes and transforms the way people shop and bank. As a partner to some of the 100 leading financial institutions and 25 largest retailers in the world, the integrated solutions of Diebold Nixdorf connect the physical and digital channels in a convenient, secure and efficient way for millions of consumers every day.

    text: "PayMate India Limited, a Mumbai-based B2B payments solutions provider, on Friday announced that the company multiplied its footprint across more regions in Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa (CEMEA), and the Asia Pacific (APAC), in addition to India and the UAE. The move comes six months after the company announced its foray into Singapore, Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia. PayMate has incorporated and registered its entity in four more markets – the Sultanate of Oman, South Africa, Malaysia and Australia. In Australia and South Africa, the company has been incorporated under the trade name DuNoMo as a wholly-owned subsidiary of PayMate India Ltd.\n\nPayMate will offer its B2B payment automation solutions to small and medium-sized (SMBs) as well as large corporate customers and enable them to use their bank-issued corporate credit cards towards their accounts payables (AP) including supplier payments, bill payments & statutory payments. This will help them to make better utilisation of their working capital for strategic business growth.\n\nB2B payments made in this manner will be settled directly into suppliers’ bank accounts, thereby opening wide acceptance of corporate credit card usage as most of these suppliers don’t accept card payments. The PayMate platform will further enable corporates with configurable approval workflows to give full control and visibility into cashflows with detailed reports, reconciliation and APIs for ERP integration with existing legacy systems.\n\nSpeaking on this expansion, Ajay Adiseshan, Founder & CEO, PayMate said: “At PayMate, our mission is to create and offer more avenues for using commercial credit cards so that the collateral-free credit on them can be utilized in an effective manner. This helps corporates of all sizes to pay their suppliers and resolve cashflow challenges. Our existing customers in India and UAE are already using our platform very effectively and with the success in these two geographies, we are now geared up to extend our solutions to businesses in more countries in CEMEA and APAC. The global expansion is part of our mission to consolidate our position as a global leader in B2B payments.”\n\nRakesh Khanna, Chief Commercial Officer, PayMate, said: “In 2021, the global commercial payments volume was estimated at $120 trillion, with CEMEA contributing approximately USD 10 trillion, and APAC estimated at $58 trillion. Therefore, in line with our strategy to capitalise on these opportunities and continue driving the PayMate B2B payment solutions in markets that are booming, we have incorporated in Malaysia, Australia, South Africa, and Oman. We are positive that the local businesses will be able to streamline their supply chain payments, reduce costs, and improve their working capital by using our solutions.”",

    text: "Overview Post By :\n\n\n\nSource: Microbioz India\n\nMicrobioz India\n\nDate : 02 Aug,2023\n\nTransCure bioServices, a humanized mouse model CRO, has partnered with Preclina Inc., a South Korean preclinical CRO specializing in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The partnership significantly expands TransCure’s reach into the APAC region, while also bolstering its service offerings to further enhance the quality of its research results. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the region will now have better access to a selection of the most advanced mouse models, as well as the full suite of services required for optimized preclinical development — capabilities that have been challenging to access in the region until now.\n\nDrug developers in APAC have typically faced many challenges when it comes to preclinical development, from limited access to animal model providers and poor service offering breadth and capacity, to a scarcity of comprehensive, one-stop-shop preclinical partners. What’s more, mouse model providers in the region may not have the standardized, well-recognized model sets used in international research, making results comparison difficult.\n\nThe partnership between TransCure bioServices and Preclina directly addresses these challenges, providing APAC customers with the full suite of advanced preclinical services under one umbrella, as well as the most advanced, internationally recognized mouse models and cell lines to help optimize and streamline their preclinical programs.\n\n“TransCure’s one-stop-shop offering spans three platforms, more than 50 proven animal models, and a vast selection of technical services,” said Kiave Ho Wang Yin, PhD, Chief Business Officer at TransCure bioServices. “By joining forces with Preclina, we further bolster those offerings with extensive autoimmune and inflammatory disease expertise, unlocking new insights for APAC-based developers, while bringing our renowned partnership-rather-than-supplier approach to the region. With this foothold, we’re uniquely positioned to grow our capacity in the region and further innovate for the benefit of our sponsors.”\n\nPreclina is renowned for its highly specialized services in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, such as NASH, fibrosis, arthritis, and scleroderma. It boasts extensive knowledge in immunology, with expertise in patient-derived cells and animal models that faithfully recapitulate these disorders. Their fully integrated drug discovery platform has made them an indispensable partner for APAC clients developing novel drugs and diagnostic and treatment technologies.\n\n“Combining our know-how and services with TransCure’s offers a unique opportunity to better address the preclinical needs of APAC customers,” said Young Mo Kang, PhD, CEO at Preclina. “We’re delighted that this partnership will further augment the high-quality, comprehensive services we’re well known for. We look forward to delivering the fruits of this collaboration to our customers, helping them carve a smoother route to better preclinical research for transformative therapeutics and diagnostics.”\n\nFor more information about TransCure bioServices, please visit: https://transcurebioservices.com/",

    title: "Carmen Davila, Ariza: LatAm expansion plan includes Argentina",
    text: "Mexico-based fleet management company Ariza created a new job position this year, being Latin America director which was assumed by Carmen Davila, former head of Mexico.\n\nDuring Global Fleet’s recent interview with the executive, we discussed company objectives and a few tips to optimizing fleet management services.\n\nAriza is the result of a partnership between the largest fleet management provider in the United States, ARI, and Mexican ground transport group Corporación Zapata.\n\nGlobal Fleet: You are now Ariza’s Latin America director. What do you expect from this new job position and what’s your main objective for 2018?\n\nDavila: I expect to continue contributing to Ariza’s growth, all while gaining more experience and skills from this new position.\n\nFor now, our coverage area is Mexico alone. However, my main objective this year is to kick off our LatAm expansion plan. Initially, we are focusing on Argentina, in addition to Peru. This is why my new position was created.\n\nGlobal Fleet: There are quite a few companies in Latin America providing services similar to Ariza. What differentiates you from your competitors?\n\nDavila: One thing to point out is that we offer transparency via our unbundled fleet management services solutions, using an open end flexible leasing model with cutting edge technology and tools.\n\nGlobal Fleet: Could you give us an idea of what Ariza is doing in terms of technology?\n\nDavila: Ariza is developing tools aimed at improving the user experience of its clients. Besides controlling the day to day transactions at the tip of their fingers, these tools will help leverage our client’s positions by enabling fleet managers to make more informed decisions.\n\nAriza's fleet information platform ARI Insights (SOURCE: Ariza)\n\nGlobal Fleet: Could you tell me a bit about Ariza’s online driver training (ODT) program?\n\nDavila: The main objective of the program is to address one of the main issues effecting fleet costs, and that is the driver. Through ODT, Ariza wants to make sure drivers are aware of the importance of their driving behavior, recognizing that this not only impacts personal safety, but costs.\n\nWith proper use of the program, accident rates are reduced along with insurance premiums, and timely preventative maintenance is accomplished. ODT is a crucial component for fleet safety as well as business productivity.\n\nGlobal Fleet: Gasoline is the main source of energy for cars nowadays, but the world is in search of more sustainable powertrain alternatives. What is Latin America’s future in this respect?\n\nDavila: That isn’t an easy question to answer as we do not have a crystal ball. Although there are alternative fuels such as biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, hybrid, natural gas, propane and hydrogen, they still pose major challenges in terms of production sources, accessibility to filling or recharging stations, and conversion costs.\n\nWe need to pay attention to the evolution of all these alternatives, but I’d say that electricity is one we should really keep an eye on over the next 10-15 years.\n\nGlobal Fleet: Any last words?\n\nDavila: Sure, choose your vehicles carefully. Consider all tax deductions and benefits you can get from particular models before purchasing as this will impact your business.",

But the Brazilian unit was not among those included in the original filing.\n\n”LATAM Airlines Brazil has started a voluntary reorganization process as part of Chapter 11 protection in the USA to restructure its debt and effectively manage its aircraft fleet, while enabling operational continuity,” the company said in an update last Friday.\n\n”LATAM Airlines Brazil’s decision is a natural step in light of the continuing Covid-19 pandemic and offers the best option to access the proposed debtor-in-possession financing that will provide the tools to adapt to this new reality.”\n\nHowever the Brazilian unit will continue to operate flights normally during the process.\n\nLATAM Airlines Group has now presented the second tranche of its debtor-in-possession financing proposal for approval to a New York court. The tranche covers US$1.3 billion that was committed by Oaktree Capital Management and its affiliates.\n\nAn earlier tranche comprising US$ 900 million was committed by shareholders Qatar Airways and the Cueto and Amaro families when LATAM made its original Chapter 11 restructuring filing.\n\n”Combined, Tranches A and C meet LATAM’s financing requirements in the context of the Covid-19 crisis and, as a result, it is hoped that financial support will not be required from governments,” the company says. ”Nonetheless, LATAM Airlines Brazil will continue advancing negotiations with Brazil’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES).”\n\nLATAM Airlines Group chief executive Roberto Alvo says: “Today, LATAM has taken a significant step in ensuring its operational continuity by securing the commitment of Oaktree Capital Management and its affiliates for the total financing of Tranche A. We hope that, together with Tranche C, it will be approved by the court in the coming weeks.\n\n”The support of two of our principal shareholders has been essential, sparking an interest and commitment from investors that we did not have a month ago. This show of confidence in the group’s future has enabled us to secure all the resources that are required to continue operating during the crisis and as demand recovers, to successfully complete the Chapter 11 process.”",

    title: "LATAM Airlines Enters the Race to Acquire Viva Air Colombia",
    text: "LATAM Airlines Colombia, an affiliate of Chile-based LATAM Airlines Group, has expressed its interest in the takeover of local low-cost carrier Viva Air Colombia.\n\nViva Air—a relatively young airline founded in 2009—has been struggling financially and eventually filed for bankruptcy last week, although it continues to operate flights as usual.\n\nBids to take over the failing airline were officially opened last year, and the Colombian flag carrier Avianca immediately expressed interest. However, the proposed merger between Avianca and Viva Air was blocked in November by Aerocivil, the Colombian civil aviation regulator. The authorities claimed that merging the two airlines would harm competition in the country’s aviation market and thus pose a risk to consumers.\n\nFollowing Aerocivil’s decision to block the acquisition, an appeal was launched by Avianca and Viva Air, and the process began again in January. Viva Air said that the authorities’ decision to block the deal means it has been unable to gain the capital needed to stay afloat.\n\n“The company has not been able to access capital during the last nine months since it has not yet been able to finalize its merger with another airline, which is still pending authorization from the National Government,” said Viva Air.\n\nThe second airline to enter the race for Viva Air was JetSMART, a Chilean low-cost carrier that announced its intention to purchase the Colombian airline last week. And now, LATAM Airlines Colombia has become the third airline to enter the bidding war. However, like JetSMART, they have yet to suggest how much they would be willing to offer.\n\n“In a written communication to the president of Viva Air Colombia and Castlesouth Limited, the company has informed that any transaction is subject to a financial analysis (which would be carried out expeditiously), an agreement between the parties, and the corresponding regulatory approvals,” said LATAM in a press release on Tuesday.\n\n“The Colombian affiliate of LATAM group is prepared and has the capacity to strengthen its operations in the country. As such, a potential acquisition of Viva Air Colombia becomes a growth opportunity, offering Colombian consumers the best value proposition in the local market in terms of service, and the country new alternatives to strengthen its connectivity and development of tourism.”\n\nHowever, Castlesouth Limited, the controlling shareholder of Viva Air, has said the ideal scenario would be for the Colombian government to approve Avianca’s takeover of the carrier, as opposed to LATAM or JetSMART.\n\n“Given Viva’s current financial condition, immediate approval by the National Government to integrate Viva with Avianca is in the best interests of Viva and its passengers, creditors, employees, and other interested parties, including the Colombian public,” said Castlesouth Limited in a statement.\n\nViva Air Colombia has a fleet of 19 Airbus A320neos and has flown more than eight million passengers into, out of, and within Colombia as of December 2022.",

    text: "Hospital e Maternidade São Luiz Itaim, Rede D’Or in São Paolo is the first hospital in Brazil to adopt Versius, which they are using as part of a multi-specialty robotic surgery programme. To support growth in Brazil and the LatAm region, CMR has opened its first office in São Paulo.\n\n\n\nAt Hospital e Maternidade São Luiz Itaim, Rede D’Or, Versius has been used to perform a of cases across gynaecology, urology and general surgery, including prostatectomy, gastric bypass, hernia repair, hysterectomy and cholecystectomy. Robotic-assisted surgical platforms such as Versius provide surgeons with precision and dexterity to enable surgeons to more easily perform complex surgical procedures through keyhole surgery. The LatAm region has a strong demand for high-tech, digitally advanced devices and are making rapid advances to adopt surgical robotics into clinical practice.\n\n\n\nBertrand Weil, Chief Business Development Officer of CMR Surgical said: “At CMR we are fully committed to bringing the benefits of minimal access surgery to all those who need it. Brazil is a highly advanced country with significant growth opportunities for surgical robotics, which makes it an ideal landscape in which to introduce Versius. Since receiving Anvisa regulatory approval late last year, we have focused on a rapid market entry to meet the strong demand for Versius – a unique and versatile new choice for surgeons and hospitals that benefits patients. We will continue driving CMR’s growth in Brazil, and look forward to expanding our reach across Latin America by building partnerships with healthcare stakeholders looking to advance the surgical care of their patients.”\n\n\n\nDr. Carlos Eduardo Domene, Head of Robotics at Rede D’Or commented: “It has been wonderful to work alongside the CMR team as they bring their highly innovative technology to Brazil. In a short space of time, their support has enabled us to complete a wide variety of surgical procedures with Versius, which has been of great benefit to my team. The versatility the system has allowed me to perform complex bariatric surgery with precision and ease. The small size and modularity of Versius enables us to easily move the system between operating theatres so that we can achieve high utilisation of the system day in and day out, bringing the benefits of robotic surgery to more of our patients.”\n\n\n\nBrazil is a strategically important market for CMR, who have made significant investment into establishing a presence to expand business operations across the LatAm region. CMR expects to rapidly grow their operational capabilities and skilled employee base across Brazil and the wider LatAm region.\n\n\n\nMario Ferradosa, Head of Commercial, Latin America at CMR Surgical said: “Brazil has a diverse healthcare system with a desire to innovate and a distinct appreciation for advanced technologies. It is fantastic that Versius is being introduced to leading surgeons who are looking for a compact robotic system to enable them to perform more keyhole surgery and achieve their targets. We have built expert teams to rapidly respond to the interest of healthcare providers and importantly provide our customers with best-in-class services as they introduce Versius into their operating rooms.”\n\n\n\nCMR’s expansion into LatAm follows regulatory approval for Versius by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, Anvisa. Further installations of Versius are underway across Brazil and also in Chile, where first cases are expected to commence imminently. With Versius launched in Brazil and Chile, CMR plans to continue momentum with rapid market launches across LatAm to quickly support demand for surgical robotics, which is a fast growth category in the region. CMR’s presence in Latin America adds to its increasing global presence in markets across Europe, Middle East, Asia and Australia where Versius is being used to perform surgical procedures across a range of surgical specialities including gynaecology, colorectal surgery, thoracic surgery general surgery and urology.\n\nImage: Courtesy of CMR Surgical",

The asset was originally sold by DLF Qutub Enclave Complex Medical Charitable Trust in 2011 to the seller.\n\nThe acquisition is a momentous milestone in Apollo Hospitals’ stellar journey in healthcare in India, and marks the entry of the group in the state of Haryana. The hospital will establish the group’s presence in the millennium city of Gurugram, one of India’s fastest growing cities, with an aspirational populace, and substantial brand equity for Apollo Hospitals, owing to its existing footprint in the region. The upcoming integrated healthcare complex located on the Golf Course Road at Gurugram would be commissioned in a span of 24 months. It would endeavour to extend advanced clinical solutions and services to the citizens of the state and the country through its experienced faculty and international collaborations, and will strongly position the city as an international healthcare destination.\n\nThe Gurugram facility would also be at the centre of incubating advancements in digital healthcare, Healthcare accelerators and start-ups and contribute towards the country’s healthcare eco system, propelling the country and the state of Haryana towards leading practices and world-class healthcare.\n\nThe Apollo Hospitals group has always worked towards building a fully operating ecosystem in all its geographies, and will accordingly work towards pollinating the benefits of advanced healthcare towards the remotest corners of the state of Haryana and would work closely with the State Government towards meeting the goals and targets put forth by the Government in its health policy vision for the state.\n\nSpread across 5.63 acres of land with 650 potential beds, Apollo Hospitals will offer its truly differentiated clinical programs in key Centres of Excellence, cutting-edge technology, sub-specialities and its inherent Clinical Excellence – not just for the residents of the city, but for all people in the National Capital Region and overseas as well.\n\nCommenting on the development, Dr Prathap C Reddy, Chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group said, “I am delighted that Apollo Hospitals has added to its presence in the North, a key area of focus for us.

    text: "Growing 5G availability in the region will increase the market’s revenue to $479b\n\nThe increasing mobile data subscription in the Asia Pacific is expected to drive the growth of total mobile communications services revenue in the region, says data and analytics firm GlobalData.\n\nAccording to its Asia-Pacific Mobile Broadband Forecast Pack (Q3 2023), the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is estimated to increase by 8% from $326.2b in 2023 to $479.1b in 2028.\n\nThe report also revealed that mobile data services will remain the largest revenue-contributing segment of the overall mobile services market in the region during the forecast period. This is due to the expansion and increasing adoption of high-average revenue per user (ARPU) 5G services across several countries.\n\nGlobalData Telecom Analyst Srikanth Vaidya said operators such as Dialog and Airtel in Sri Lanka, and Grameenphone, Robi and Teletalk in Bangladesh are gearing up for the rollout of 5G service in their respective countries by 2024.\n\nGovernment support for 5G expansion will also strengthen the mobile data services market in the APAC region. For instance, telecom regulatory bodies and governing authorities in South Korea, Japan, Australia, China, and Taiwan have launched national 5G strategies or action plans, outlining the vision and guidelines to establish 5G ecosystems.\n\nThese policies include public sector investments in 5G applications, favourable tax incentives and deductions, forums for industry-government collaboration, promotion of 5G led-technological innovations, and license arrangements to enhance spectrum use and reuse.\n\nFor instance, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) recently announced plans to deploy 2.9 million 5G base stations by the end of 2023 and 3.6 million by 2025 to expand 5G service coverage to rural areas and industrial parks.\n\nChina is currently the largest 5G market in the world with an estimated 1.5 billion 5G subscriptions in 2023. With the investments and regulatory efforts to expand the network in the country, this is set to go up to 3.3 billion by the end of 2028.\n\n“APAC has become the centre of a technological race for 5G+ supremacy. South Korea, Japan, and China have gone beyond just the deployment of 5G to the development of the wider 5G ecosystem. This also means supporting the vast electronics manufacturing and ICT industries in these countries,” Vaidya said.",

    text: "Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (Nasdaq: GILT, TASE: GILT) has been awarded a multimillion-dollar contract for the expansion of SATCOM capabilities on trains in Asia-Pacific (APAC).\n\nGilat’s ER7000 SATCOM On-The-Move antennas were selected by a leading integrator for installation on trains to provide continuous internet access to passengers traveling across the APAC region.\n\nThroughout the world, Gilat’s field-proven ER7000 antennas have been successfully deployed to empower SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) applications. They provide reliable, high-performance broadband connectivity for vehicles and rail travel, maximizing throughput with high efficiency in a low-profile system with minimal size and weight. These features make the ER7000 ideally suited for these applications, enabling real-time broadband satellite communications for video, voice, and data transfer.\n\n“For many applications, SATCOM on-the-move is the only choice for reliable, continuous, and quickly deployable broadband connectivity. This project is an excellent example of how Gilat antenna systems can be used to provide better management of complex transportation networks, as well as reliable internet coverage for passengers,” said Amir Yafe, VP of Mobility & Global Accounts at Gilat. “We are excited with the prospect of working on more projects like these to be deployed in the future.”",

      "Autodesk Expands BuildingConnected into EMEA and APAC to Give Global Construction Teams Access to Best-in-Class Bid Management Solution",
    text: "General contractors and subcontractors in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand can now use BuildingConnected to streamline the bidding process and ensure the right team is in place before breaking ground\n\nSan Rafael, CA – October 13, 2020 – Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) today announced the international expansion of BuildingConnected, a construction management solution that centralizes and streamlines the bidding process, and encompasses the Autodesk Construction Cloud builders network, a crowdsourced network of construction professionals. Owners and general contractors use BuildingConnected to discover trade partners and identify the right subcontractor for the job, and to solicit and compare bids – also referred to as tenders – from one central location. With its international expansion, the BuildingConnected solution is now available in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n“There are more than one million construction professionals on the BuildingConnected network in North America alone, with over 2,000 general contractors and owners actively bidding out projects – totaling $56 billion in project values each month,” said Jim Lynch, vice president and general manager of Autodesk Construction Solutions. “BuildingConnected effectively replaces an antiquated approach that has relied on Rolodexes and spreadsheets, and ensures the right teams are in place for every kind of construction project, whether a commercial building, data center, medical facility or infrastructure project. As BuildingConnected further expands internationally, we want to empower construction firms around the world with the resources they need to increase productivity and decrease project risk.”\n\nFor estimating teams, BuildingConnected helps save time and increases collaboration in managing the bidding process with automated workflows that facilitate securing the best team for a construction project. Estimators and bid coordinators can use the solution’s network of subcontractors and bid management capabilities to find, qualify and invite subcontractors to bid on a job, and then use its advanced bid comparison features to view all bid packages from one place with access to the real-time status of bids and project costs.\n\nBuildingConnected empowers preconstruction teams to:\n\nQuickly solicit bids with customizable templates and accurately compare those bids in a side-by-side “apples-to-apples” fashion\n\nTrack against internal budgets with real-time cost updates\n\nEasily collaborate with other estimators on the team, and follow communications and bid versions\n\nExport bids and summary sheets for transparent collaboration with owners\n\nGain valuable insight into historical bid data and reports to optimize for future projects\n\nSave time and reduce risk through the tendering process in the United Kingdom and Ireland\n\nInviting, submitting and reviewing tenders has historically been a tedious and time-consuming process, with building companies in the United Kingdom and Ireland commonly using a piecemeal combination of software such as email, cloud-hosted files, in-house technology and in many cases, paper. Using disconnected systems during tendering often results in inefficiencies and data loss that leads to costly mistakes, with general contractors and subcontractors losing time chasing or adding information after proposals are submitted.\n\n“Mitigating risk during the preconstruction phase, which is when costly rework is most avoidable, is massively important to any company’s gross margin,” said Mike Pettinella, director of EMEA sales of Autodesk Construction Solutions. “Keeping data loss to a minimum while planning construction projects is one of the most critical aspects of mitigating risk. By bringing the entire tendering process under one roof, teams can keep both communication and data fluid, transparent and consistent across stakeholders. BuildingConnected will have a big impact for construction companies in the U.K. and Ireland on both sides of the tendering process.”\n\nTo learn more about the survey of construction firms in the United Kingdom and Ireland, please visit here.\n\nStandardize and centralize communication during the tendering process in Australia and New Zealand\n\nAccording to research soon to be released by Autodesk, both general contractors and specialty contractors in Australia and New Zealand call out centralized communication as a top quality that determines repeat business with a subcontractor. By standardizing and bringing all tender-related communication to one central location, BuildingConnected empowers teams to be transparent and collaborate more effectively.\n\n“Information siloes and communication breakdowns have unfortunately become an accepted part of the tendering process” said Mark Swann, Construction Manager at Serneke Australia, a construction and development company focused on multi-residential and community buildings. “BuildingConnected gives us back a tremendous amount of time from chasing emails and updating addendums to tenders. We can now immediately track and follow up with subcontractors, all from one location where we have access to the most up-to-date information for seamless and efficient tender management.”\n\nJoin our webinars to learn more about preconstruction and BuildingConnected\n\nFor construction professionals in the UK and Ireland, join us on October 15, 2020 to learn more about connected construction and tackling procurement challenges in preconstruction. We’ll explore recently conducted research to examine how clients, main contractors and subcontractors approach procurement today. You can register to attend the event here.\n\nFor construction professionals in Australia and New Zealand, join us on November 4, 2020, as we host a panel of building procurement experts who will share their experiences tackling the challenges of procurement and discuss findings from our recent research on how owners, head contractors and subcontractors approach procurement today. You can register to attend the event here.\n\nBuildingConnected is now available for customers in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Ireland.

    text: "FinTech start-up builds integration engine to shore up WLTH Pay user experience and mergers activity.\n\nBoomi, the intelligent connectivity and automation leader, has announced Australian digital lending and payments provider WLTH is using the Boomi AtomSphere Platform to create an integrated technology and data foundation to support its growth roadmap, including the launch and expansion of its finance and payments business, and future mergers and acquisitions (M&As).\n\nWith the goal to finance AU $1.2 billion worth of residential and commercial loans by the end of the 2022 financial year, Brisbane-based FinTech WLTH is doubling down on its bid to increase customer acquisition. The next phase of this roadmap is to diversify beyond lending, with increased investment into its payments services, including the launch of business products via its state-of-the-art payments platform WLTH Pay.\n\nDave Chapman, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at WLTH\n\nDave Chapman, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at WLTH, was appointed to stand up technology for WLTH Pay, and the key to this role was establishing a connected IT environment capable of synchronising critical business functions in the app and delivering the user experience the product promises.\n\n“We’re looking to take the headache out of finances, and whether it’s to manage personal money or a small-to-medium business, customers need to trust their payments experience will be reliable and easy,” said Chapman. “But access at anytime, anywhere doesn’t happen out of thin air – there are hundreds of data sets running across different technologies and cloud service providers that need to be synchronized.”\n\nWLTH selected Boomi’s low code, cloud-native integration platform as a service (iPaaS) to connect myriad systems and data across the business, including standard and biometric identity management capabilities, transactional payments platforms, operational and analytical data stores, industry critical know-your-customer (KYC) and know-your-business (KYB) providers, and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms.\n\nBoomi’s ability to securely consolidate and synchronize all of WLTH’s operational, customer and transactional data in its Master Data Hub platform has built an environment capable of onboarding new products and third-party services easily. The benefits extend to giving the FinTech’s employees access to pan-organizational golden records they need to gain a singular view of every part of the business and use that data for better business outcomes.\n\nChapman said: “In seconds, Boomi can handle the load of thousands of customer transactions, and with the same speed, collate it accurately and build intelligence into our analytics engine. We’re putting the value back into value-add activities, highlighting data as the most important currency in our employees’ workday. When it comes to creating better business outcomes, this extends from day-to-day customer support, right through to delivering better concierge experiences, or initiatives like our Parley for the Oceans’ Australian Clean-up Efforts.”\n\n“For every home loan that is settled, WLTH will assist and empower Parley for the Oceans teams to clean up 50m2 of a beach or coastline throughout Australia and around the world.\n\n“Environmental sustainability is who we are and with an IT environment that is clean and cleansed, our staff can facilitate more meaningful engagements that not only please customers but give back to our oceans.”\n\nWith its applications and systems integrated, the real-time data connectivity has also enabled a single sign-on (SSO) functionality for WLTH’s customers and employees.\n\nChapman said: “Boomi integrates every corner of our application and data stack, and that interconnectedness is the beating heart of the omni-channel experience we’re promising to deliver. With the power of single sign-on, WLTH Pay will remember the unique user and enable them to shift from the website to their mobile devices seamlessly and pain-free.”\n\nWLTH is also using the Boomi platform to support its most recent corporate merger with an unnamed payments platform, which is set to provide the underlying technology infrastructure for WLTH Pay and will ensure customers can access the product seamlessly via one platform.\n\nTo implement the Boomi-based iPaaS environment, WLTH engaged the services of trusted IT service provider Atturra. As three-time winner of Boomi’s APJ Partner of the Year award, Atturra led the integration of all business-critical systems that make up WLTH’s best-of-breed technology environment, while creating a framework for when new digital assets enter the business.\n\n“Boomi’s catalogue of big-ticket connectors is complemented by Atturra’s fit-for-purpose reference architecture, which has made the handling of the third-party systems and applications that power WLTH Pay far easier to manage than we could have imagined,” added Chapman.\n\nSpeaking of Atturra’s role in delivering the project, Jason Frost, Executive General Manager at Atturra Data and Integration, said: “We bring extensive integration experience in the financial services sector, and this has proved invaluable in delivering an integration framework that meets WLTH’s desire to deliver top-notch customer experience and futureproof the business.”\n\nNathan Gower, Managing Director Australia and New Zealand (A/NZ) at Boomi, said by honing-in on its technology stack, WLTH has put itself in the driver’s seat to make headway on its appetite for growth.\n\n“With a comprehensive roadmap to transform the industry and widen its reach, WLTH cannot wait for IT to ‘get there when it gets there’,” said Gower. “By forming the best application and data integration foundation, the start-up has built a framework capable of supporting stronger experience for WLTH Pay users, as well as protecting its hunger for future M&As with the ease to connect new applications and data as they enter the business.”\n\nClick below to share this article",

Apollo helps us to achieve these goals while also supporting our customers’ sustainable growth and scalability targets.”\n\nThe AI platform has already demonstrated its effectiveness, identifying approximately 18 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of expected and realized energy savings across the 16 sites, the equivalent energy usage of approximately 1,600+ U.S. households over the course of a year.\n\nApollo’s ability to autonomously detect anomalies such as clogged filters and leaky valves and to suggest optimizations to operational settings without human intervention, enhances the effectiveness of Digital Realty’s site managers and engineers.\n\nApollo uses Machine Learning to provide a comprehensive dashboard that lists optimization opportunities at each facility, prioritized by potential megawatt-hour savings.\n\nThe platform’s self-learning capabilities aggregate findings, which are then audited and applied to newly onboarded facilities.\n\nThis ensures that every new site contributes value to the platform, benefiting the entire portfolio.\n\nClick below to share this article",

It specialises in using AI to improve brand advertising performance and outcomes, offering real-time consumer sentiment to build audiences. With its roots in mobile in-app video and gaming, LoopMe currently supports the technology and retail sectors, while focusing on the financial services, fast-moving consumer goods and other industries in the APAC region.\n\n"One of the company\'s priorities is to invest in and grow our APAC business. Hong Kong is not only close to mainland China, but is also one of the most international cities in the APAC region. The city has a very unique mix of Chinese and Western ideas, which sets it apart from other APAC markets. It also has a deep pool of talent with Mainland and global perspectives. This is the best place for us to serve our Mainland clients and expand our business in the region," said Bernard Fung (pictured), who was recently promoted to managing director and head of North APAC, LoopMe.\n\nFung also said that LoopMe closed out last year with US$150 million in revenue, reporting 55% global growth year-on-year and 27% growth year-on-year in the APAC region alone.

Apart from a strategic location, our city also has a world-class Internet connectivity which provides an excellent online and mobile platform for digital marketers. Hong Kong\'s re-opening of the border with the mainland would certainly boost the local economy and cross-border business activities. We hope that LoopMe can fully tap into these opportunities to achieve its best year ever in the APAC region," said Jimmy Chiang, associate director-general of investment promotion.\n\nBack in October 2017, LoopMe expanded into Asia Pacific through the opening of its Singapore office.

    title: "Pinterest expands partnership with LiveRamp across APAC markets",
    text: "Data collaboration platform LiveRamp has announced an expanded partnership with social platform Pinterest, adding APAC countries to the list of markets where advertisers can now activate campaigns.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, and Japan have been added to existing markets such as the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and select European markets. The move aims to enable better global integration for advertisers to reach their audiences on Pinterest's platform globally.\n\nThrough the partnership, marketers will be able to reach their customers on Pinterest with seamless activation on RampID, LiveRamp’s pseudonymous, people-based identifier.\n\nPreviously, LiveRamp and Pinterest announced a partnership using LiveRamp’s interoperable clean room technology as a collaborative platform for brands, publishers, retailers, and data owners to advance measurement without compromising data protection. LiveRamp’s data collaboration technology provides a protected space where advertisers can join select first-party data and Pinterest platform data in a secure environment.\n\nBuilding on this existing partnership, the new integration will improve measurement and analytics for advertisers, as well as create opportunities for brands to get more value from first-party data. By leveraging this integration, CPG buyers will be able to reach retail media network audiences including Carrefour and Albertsons. At a time when ROI matters more than ever, marketers can benefit from the performance and access to insights that this partnership—as well as RampID—enables.\n\n“In this evolving macro economic climate, every dollar marketers spend must be addressable and measurable, and we’re excited to offer marketers across the world the ability to seamlessly leverage RampID for people-based marketing on Pinterest, enabling better campaigns and better measurement,” said Travis Clinger, SVP, activations & addressability, LiveRamp. “By building on identity that can power better data collaboration in the future, marketers can begin building enduring brand and business value.”\n\nMarketers can also benefit from LiveRamp's 100% cookieless integration with Pinterest as they prioritise cookieless campaigns ahead of Chrome's deadline to phase them out in 2H 2024. Additionally, the integration makes it possible for marketers to use people-based marketing without having to give up control over their customers' personal information or transfer data outside of their company.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report published last week, Pinterest reported US$708 million in revenue with sales in the company’s second quarter jumping 6% year over year. The social platform's CEO Bill Ready recently said in an interview with CNBC that Gen Z is the platform's fastest-growing cohort.\n\n“It was our best user growth quarter in more than two years,” Ready said. “Gen Z is our fastest-growing cohort, and they’re engaging more deeply than prior cohorts.”\n\nPinterest continues to see significant user growth and now has more than 465 million monthly active users worldwide who use the platform to find goods and services for a variety of needs, including finding clothes, a new house, travel plans, and much more.\n\n“We’re excited to continue building on the momentum of our privacy-centric data collaboration and measurement partnerships with LiveRamp. We’re now enabling even more marketers around the world to activate on Pinterest without compromising on control or privacy,” said Bill Watkins, chief revenue officer at Pinterest.",

Get updates on your preferred social platform Follow us for the latest news, insider access to events and more.\n\nGlobal email security and backup provider, Hornetsecurity , has today announced a major push into several different regions across the world, with the signing of new distributors and partnerships. This further expands Hornetsecurity's established presence in Europe, the US and LATAM.In the Philippines and Saudi Arabia, the signing of distributors WSI and S2 will see Hornetsecurity's capabilities support even more businesses in limiting cybersecurity issues. EMT have been appointed as distributors of Hornetsecurity solutions in the Middle East. In Eastern Europe, software distributors ED&R Polska in Poland and PBCom in the Czech Republic have been selected due to their significant Microsoft presence. In Australia, Datastor Australia has expanded its portfolio from Altaro backup solutions for Microsoft 365 to the full range of Hornetsecurity cyber solutions, adding email cloud security and compliance into the mix.These agreements, covering more than 10 countries, will take Hornetsecurity's flagship 365 Total Protection suite and 365 Total Backup far deeper into their respective Microsoft communities. Colin Wright , VP, ROW, Hornet security , commented: \"In signing these agreements, we have made a significant expansion commitment into APAC and Eastern Europe. Microsoft retains significant dominance in the region, so it makes sense that our complementary next-gen email security, backup and compliance solutions should grow alongside as the number one third-party provider. To date, we've focused largely on Western Europe and the Americas, but now we have a dedicated team to roll out Hornetsecurity into APAC and we are finding initial demand really exciting.\"Hazel Escanlar, General Manager WSI, commented: \"We're one of the leading distributors in the Philippines, and we've taken the decision to expand our cybersecurity portfolio with Hornetsecurity because of its alternate stance on becoming the number one end-to-end supplier of cybersecurity and set-and-forget backups for Microsoft for SMBs , and all controlled from one easy-to-use control panel for those offering managed services. With Hornetsecurity, it's all about convenience and flexibility to give MSPs peace of mind while reducing their demands on time.\"From a partner perspective, 365 Total Backup enables managed service providers (MSPs) and value-added resellers (VARs) to provide backup and recovery services for Microsoft 365 mailboxes, Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. They can easily take backups and manage them through a multi-tenant, cloud-based control panel. 365 Total Protection Enterprise Backup combines this functionality with state-of-the-art email security that protects against spam, viruses, phishing and ransomware; as well as providing Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), email signatures and disclaimers, automated email continuity and legally compliant email archiving. Daniel Hofmann , CEO, Hornetsecurity, explained, \"Through these new appointments, we can offer a great market opportunity to more partners globally. They can now bring their customers to Microsoft 365 in a secure, safe and compliant mode, through our next-gen solutions. We also provide them with the unique benefit of being able to back up the data shared via User Chats in Microsoft Teams as well as Group Channel Conversations, something other vendors are not able to do. This strong market position gives our partners a compelling advantage.\"",

      "Pragmatic Play expands LatAm footprint through multi-vertical content deal with GanaPlay",
    text: '2023-11-14\n\nReading time 1:47 min\n\niGaming content provider Pragmatic Play has signed a new partnership agreement with operator GanaPlay, further strengthening its position in the Latin American market.\n\nThe new deal will see the delivery of content from three of Pragmatic Play’s product lines among players in the region, with Slots taking center stage. Content like the Big Bass Bonanza and John Hunter series will debut on GanaPlay’s platform, alongside more recent titles such as Twilight Princess and Candy Blitz.\n\nLive Casino has long been a mainstay of operators in Latin America and the success of contemporary experiences like Vegas Ball Bonanza, balanced by a strong selection of classic table games, is expected to continue that pattern for visitors to GanaPlay’s site, says the supplier.\n\nLastly, fans of sports betting will also be catered for with an array of Virtual Sports offering a range of betting markets against the backdrop of on-demand sports action, recreated with cutting-edge animation across titles like Force 1, football, horse and greyhound racing.\n\n"With this latest agreement, Pragmatic Play continues to expand commercially across a region that is a hotbed of activity across its respective casino and sports betting markets," the company said in a press release.\n\nVictor Arias, Vice President of Latin American Operations at ARRISE powering Pragmatic Play, said: “GanaPlay is a respected name and one of a number of partners that Pragmatic Play has allied itself with to further its growth strategy. It’s another shop window for the region’s favorite casino content and I have no doubt that it will continue to perform as successfully here as everywhere else.”\n\n\n\nVictor Arias\n\nAndres Clavijo, CEO of GanaPlay, added: “Pragmatic Play games are in high demand from our players, so to be able to supply them now we’ve reached an agreement is a considerable coup for us. Once they roll out, our brand will be significantly stronger and as we maintain our place in a tightly packed and highly competitive market.”\n\nPragmatic Play currently produces up to eight new online slot titles a month, while also delivering Live Casino and Bingo games as part of its multi-product portfolio, available through one single API.\n\nThe new partnership comes as the supplier prepares to showcase its gaming portfolio at the upcoming edition of the EGR Power Latam Rio Summit, the last stop of the company\'s Latin American exhibition itinerary for 2023.\n\nThe event, which takes place at the JW Marriott Hotel in Rio de Janeiro on 21 and 22 of November, will see experts from across the Latin American iGaming market come together to explore the opportunities and developments in Brazil. Pragmatic Play will be a sponsor at the event, which will be host to two days of panels and open forums.',

      "GiG expands LatAm partnership with Boldt Group to power bplay's launch in two new Argentinean provinces",
    text: '2022-08-12\n\nReading time 1:54 min\n\niGaming technology company Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) is expanding its reach in Latin America as it has signed an additional agreement with existing partner Grupo Boldt, to cover a fourth and fifth regulated region under the bplay brand over the coming months.\n\nAfter three previous entries into LatAm markets in 2020 and 2021, GiG is powering the launch of bplay in Buenos Aires, the biggest province of Argentina, with both its player account manager and sportsbook. A fifth launch is expected to follow towards the end of the year in the Argentinian Province of Entre Rios, a jurisdiction where the bplay brand will benefit from its current exclusivity, the company says.\n\nGiG explained that the expansion of its relationship with Grupo Boldt marks a continuation of its commitment to development in regulated markets, highlighting its position as "a leading partner for iGaming operators in Latin America."\n\n"The strong and steady growth of the three live regulations has already shown strong revenue opportunities, with the expectation for further expansion following the addition of these new markets," officials added.\n\nHervé Schlosser, Managing Director of Sportnco Gaming at GiG, said: "It is exciting to be playing a big part of the expanding digital iGaming market for LatAm. Our partnership with Grupo Boldt and the bplay brand promises a great deal of potential, leveraging our combined knowledge and expertise to further consolidate our commerciality in the region.”\n\nJose del Pino, Business Unit Manager at Grupo Boldt, added: "Bplay continues to bring the best gaming experience for our customers in Latin America, leading not only in launching new licenses, incorporating new and great games and products, but also proud of being the absolute leader in customer satisfaction, which is the one true podium that we deeply cherish. Our partnership with GiG and Sportnco Gaming has been a fundamental pillar for delivering the bplay experience and I look forward to continuing growing together.”\n\nLast week, GiG announced that GiG Marketplace had signed a partnership with personalized retention services company Enteractive. By joining GiG Marketplace, Enteractive aims to reach a new pool of clients that will benefit from the company\'s reactivation and retention services, by increasing bottom line revenues through elevated active player numbers.\n\nAdditionally, in line with its Latin American expansion, also last week, the company announced a new deal with operator Betsson Group to provide its platform in Colombia. The agreement has been signed for an initial period of two years, with the potential to be further extended if desired.',
